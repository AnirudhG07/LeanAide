The following is a JSON format for proofs. 

Each JSON object has a "type" field. The possible values for this field are: "define", "observe", "assert", "theorem", "question", "problem", "assume", "let", "have", "consider", "choose", "proof", "cases", "induction", "case", "remark". An object can also have a "name" field, which is a string, to be used for reference (for instance it may be the name of a theorem). The different types of objects and their additional fields are as follows:

* **Fix**: For a statement introducing a new variable.
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Variable**: the variable being defined.
    * **Kind**: the type of the variable, such as `real number`, `function from S to T`, `element of G` etc.
    * **Property**: (optional) specific properties of the variable beyond the kind.
* **Let**: For a statement introducing a new variable which has a given EXPLICIT and UNIQUE value.  
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Variable**: the variable being defined.
    * **Value**: the value being assigned to the variable.
    * * If the value is not unique, then this SHOULD INSTEAD BE a **fix** or **choose** statement (use **choose** if existence of element with the property is proved and used).
* **Have**: This is an anonymous let/fix statement, introducing an ANONYMOUS object such as a topology, group action etc to be used implicitly.
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Value**: the value of the anonymous object being introduced.
  * If the object has name or notation, use **let** or **fix** instead.
* **Consider**: This is an anonymous let/fix statement, focussing on an anonymous object such as a topology, group action etc to be used implicitly.
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Value**: the value of the anonymous object being introduced.
* **Assume**: A mathematical assumption being made. In case this is a variable or structure being introduced, use the **let** or **have** type.
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Statement**: the mathematical assumption.
* **Choose**: Set a variable to an element with a property, like **fix** but where existence of an object with the property is proved.
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Variable**: the variable being defined.
    * **Kind**: the type and properties of the variable.
    * **Existence**: (optional) A JSON list of objects giving a proof of existence, where it is not obvious that such an object exists.
* **Define**: A mathematical definition.
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Statement**: the mathematical definition.
    * **Term**: the term being defined.
* **Observe**: A mathematical statement whose proof is a simple calculation or deduction hence can be omitted.
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Claim**: the mathematical observation being claimed.
    * The statement should be a CLAIM only, not containing justification or words like "therefore", "then", "hence" and "so". A statement saying that one claim holds because another claim holds should either be an **assert** statement or be split into two or more **observe**/**assert** statements.
* **Assert**: A mathematical statement whose proof is a straightforward consequence of given results following some method.
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Claim**: the mathematical claim being asserted, NOT INCLUDING proofs, justifications or results used. The claim should be purely a logical statement which is the *consequence* obtained.
    * **Deduced_from**: a JSON list of results used to prove the claim, each result either the name of a theorem or a short statement previously proved.
    * **Proof-method** (optional): the method of proof for the claim; this should be a single phrase or a fairly simple sentence; if a longer justification is needed break the step into smaller steps.
* **Theorem**: The statement of a mathematical theorem, lemma or claim.
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Hypothesis**: a JSON list of data and assumptions, i.e., **fix**, **let**, **have**, **assume**, or **choose** statements.
    * **Conclusion**: the mathematical theorem as a consequence of the assumptions.
    * **Status**: one of "stated", "recalled", "proved earlier", "proved", "proved later".
    * Depending on the status, at most one of:
      * **Proof**: the proof, if the status is "proved".
      * **Ref**: reference to earlier proof, if the status is "proved earlier" or "proved later".
      * **Cite**: reference to literature or external sources, if the status is "recalled"; for well known results, this is omitted.  
* **Question**: A mathematical question that is not a theorem, such as "Find ..."
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Statement**: the problem statement.
    * **Solved**: Boolean field whether the solution is given.
    * **Solution**: (optional) If the "solved" field is true, a "solution" field which is a ProofJSON block.
* **Problem**: A mathematical problem that is not a theorem, such as "Find ..."
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Statement**: the problem statement.
    * **Solved**: Boolean field whether the solution is given.
    * **Solution**: (optional) If the "solved" field is true, a "solution" field which is a ProofJSON block.
* **Proof**: A proof of a theorem, lemma or claim.
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Steps**: a JSON list of steps in the proof.
* **Case**: A case in a proof.
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Condition**: the case statement.
    * **Proof**: a ProofJSON block. 
* **Induction**: An induction in a proof.
  * Additional fields: 
    * **On**: the variable on which induction is being done.
    * **Proof-cases**: a JSON list of cases in the induction, which are all objects of type **case**.
* **Cases**: A case split in a proof.
  * Additional fields: 
    * **On**: the variable, condition or property on which the case split is being done.
    * **Proof-cases**: a JSON list of cases in the case split, which are all objects of type **case**.
* **Contradiction**: A proof by contradiction.
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Assumption**: the assumption being made to contradict.
    * **Proof**: a ProofJSON block proving the negation of the assumption.
* **Remark**: A remark or comment that is not mathematical, instead being for motivation, attention, sectioning etc.
  * Additional fields: 
    * **Statement**: the remark or comment.

The following is a mathematical proof, which may or may not be correct, which is to be written in the JSON format:

---

${proof}

---

Write the following proof in the JSON format. Note that the proof may be incorrect. If any step is incorrect or ambiguous, add a field **error** to any of the above types of objects describing the error. If a step needs more proof, add a field **missing** which is a JSON list of **problem** fields which are problems that need to be solved or results that need to be proved to complete the proof. For missing details use a **missing** field, not an **error** field.
