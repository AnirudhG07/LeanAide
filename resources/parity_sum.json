We establish that the sum of an integer of odd parity and an integer of even parity results in an integer of odd parity. The proof is constructed from first principles, relying on the formal definitions of even and odd integers and the closure properties of the set of integers under addition."

Parity is a foundational concept in number theory, computer science, and abstract algebra, providing the basis for many elementary and advanced results. The behavior of integers under arithmetic operations with respect to their parity follows a well-defined set of rules, often referred to as \"parity arithmetic.\""

While these rules are intuitively understood and frequently applied, a formal demonstration is essential for mathematical rigor.
