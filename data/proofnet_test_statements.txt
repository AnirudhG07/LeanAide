Prove that if the following two conditions hold then $R$ is a Principal Ideal Domain: (i) any two nonzero elements $a$ and $b$ in $R$ have a greatest common divisor which can be written in the form $r a+s b$ for some $r, s \in R$, and (ii) if $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots$ are nonzero elements of $R$ such that $a_{i+1} \mid a_{i}$ for all $i$, then there is a positive integer $N$ such that $a_{n}$ is a unit times $a_{N}$ for all $n \geq N$.
Let $R=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]$ where $n$ is a squarefree integer greater than 3. Prove that $2, \sqrt{-n}$ and $1+\sqrt{-n}$ are irreducibles in $R$.
