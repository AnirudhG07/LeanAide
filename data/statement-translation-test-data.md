Every Cauchy sequence in a discrete metric space is eventually constant.

For any group $G$, if $o(G) = p^n$ where $p$ is a prime number, then $Z(G) \neq \left<e\right>$.

Let $f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \ldots + a_n x^n$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients. Suppose that for some prime $p$, $p \ndiv a_n$, $p \div a_1$, $p \div a_2$, ..., $p \div a_n$, $p \div a_0$, $p^2 \ndiv a_0$. Then $f(x)$ is irreducible over the rationals.

> Eisenstein's criterion. This may be too well-known, maybe it should be replaced with a special case or an application of it, such as - "The polynomial $1 + x + \ldots + x^{p-1}$, where $p$ is a prime number, is irreducible over the rationals."

The measure of the central angle of a circle is double the measure of the inscribed angle when both angles intercept the same arc.

---

If $\mathcal{p}$ is a prime ideal of a commutative ring $A$, the prime ideals of the local ring $A_{\mathcal{p}}$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the prime ideals of $A$ contained in $\mathcal{p}$.

The sum of squares of the Fourier coefficients of a function is equal to the integral of the square of the function.

The Ramanujan sum $c_n(m)$ is defined as

$$c_n(m) = \sum_{1 \leq h \leq n \\ (h, n) = 1} e(\frac{hm}{n})$$

where $e(t) = e^{2\pi i t}$. Then 

$$c_n(m) = \sum_{d \vert (m, n)} d \mu(\frac{n}{d})$$.

where $\mu$ is the MÃ¶bius function.

A monoid object in the category of monoids is a commutative monoid.

Suppose $\mu$ is a positive measure on $X$, $\mu(X) < \infty$, $f \in L^{\infty}(\mu)$, $\vert\vert f \vert\vert_{\infty} > 0$ and 

$$\alpha_n = \int_X \vert f \vert ^ n d \mu (n \in \N) $$

Then $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\alpha_{n+1}}{\alpha_n} = \vert\vert f \vert\vert_{\infty}$.

A finite open cover always has a continuous partition of unity subordinated to it, provided the space is locally compact and Hausdorff.

---

Suppose that $f : \C \to \C$ is analytic such that $Im(f)$ is a subset of a circle. Then $f$ is constant.

---

Let $X$ be a space with a basepoint $x_0$. Let $A$ and $B$ be open subsets that contain $x_0$ and satisfy $X = A \cup B$. Assume that $A$ and $B$ are path-connected and $A \cap B$ is simply-connected. Then $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is isomorphic to the free product of $\pi_1(A, x_0)$ and $\pi_1(B, x_0)$.

> This is a special case of Van Kampen's theorem. Again, this may be too well-known to be a good prompt.

If a continuous linear operator between Banach spaces is surjective, then it is an open map.

The standard $0$-simplex is the terminal object in the category of simplicial sets.

For a module $M$, if a sub-module $N$ and the quotient $M/N$ are both finitely generated, then so is $M$.

The strongly connected components of an arbitrary directed graph form a partition into subgraphs that are themselves strongly connected.

---

Let $0 \to M_0 \to M_1 \to \ldots \to M_n \to 0$ be an exact sequence in the category of $A$-modules. Then for any additive function $\lambda$ on this sequence, we have $$\sum_{i = 0}^n (-1)^i \lambda(M_i) = 0$$. 

---

Let $G$ be a finite group of automorphisms of a ring $A$, and let $A^G$ denote the sub-ring of $G$-invariants, that is of all $x \in A$ such that $\sigma(x) = x$ for all $\sigma \in G$. Then $A$ is integral over $A^G$.

The equation $x^3 + y^3 = u \cdot z^3$, where $u$ is a fixed unit in $\Z[\omega]$ has no integral solutions $(x, y, z)$ $xyz \neq 0$ where $x, y, z \in \Z[\omega]$ and $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity.
