Let $q \in \mathbb{Z}$ be a prime with $q \equiv 3 \bmod 4$. Then the quotient ring $\mathbb{Z}[i] /(q)$ is a field with $q^{2}$ elements.
The ring $\mathbb{Z}\left[x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \ldots\right] /\left(x_{1} x_{2}, x_{3} x_{4}, x_{5} x_{6}, \ldots\right)$ contains infinitely many minimal prime ideals.
$x^4-4x^3+6$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$.
$x^4+4x^3+6x^2+2x+1$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$.
The polynomial $x^{2}-\sqrt{2}$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$. 
As vector spaces over $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}^n \cong \mathbb{R}$, for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$.
