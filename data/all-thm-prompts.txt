The Gaussian integers form a unique factorisation domain.
The measure of the central angle of a circle is double the measure of the inscribed angle when both angles intercept the same arc.
The sum of squares of the Fourier coefficients of a function is equal to the integral of the square of the function.
The closure operator on a set is idempotent and monotone.
A field has characteristic zero if its underlying Abelian group is a torsion-free group.

A monoid object in the category of monoids is a commutative monoid.
The absolute value of a linear form on a real vector space is a seminorm.
A discrete valuation ring is a local Dedekind domain that is not a field.
A category with an initial object and pushouts has coproducts given by the pushouts from the initial object.
If a continuous linear operator between Banach spaces is surjective, then it is an open map.
