This theorem establishes **Leibniz's series for `œÄ`**: The alternating sum of the reciprocals  of the odd numbers is `œÄ/4`. Note that this is a conditionally rather than absolutely convergent  series. The main tool that this proof uses is the Mean Value Theorem (specifically avoiding the  Fundamental Theorem of Calculus).   Intuitively, the theorem holds because Leibniz's series is the Taylor series of `arctan x`  centered about `0` and evaluated at the value `x = 1`. Therefore, much of this proof consists of  reasoning about a function    `f := arctan x - ‚àë i in finset.range k, (-(1:‚Ñù))^i * x^(2*i+1) / (2*i+1)`,  the difference between `arctan` and the `k`-th partial sum of its Taylor series. Some ingenuity is  required due to the fact that the Taylor series is not absolutely convergent at `x = 1`.   This proof requires a bound on `f 1`, the key idea being that `f 1` can be split as the sum of  `f 1 - f u` and `f u`, where `u` is a sequence of values in [0,1], carefully chosen such that  each of these two terms can be controlled (in different ways).   We begin the proof by (1) introducing that sequence `u` and then proving that another sequence  constructed from `u` tends to `0` at `+‚àû`. After (2) converting the limit in our goal to an  inequality, we (3) introduce the auxiliary function `f` defined above. Next, we (4) compute the  derivative of `f`, denoted by `f'`, first generally and then on each of two subintervals of [0,1].  We then (5) prove a bound for `f'`, again both generally as well as on each of the two  subintervals. Finally, we (6) apply the Mean Value Theorem twice, obtaining bounds on `f 1 - f u`  and `f u - f 0` from the bounds on `f'` (note that `f 0 = 0`).
 **Strict inequality case of Rearrangement Inequality**: Pointwise scalar multiplication of `f` and `g`, which monovary together, is strictly decreased by a permutation if and only if `f` and `g ‚àò œÉ` do not monovary together. Stated by permuting the entries of `g`.

This theorem establishes the Wallis Product for `œÄ`. Our proof is largely about analyzing  the behavior of the ratio of the integral of `sin x ^ n` as `n ‚Üí ‚àû`.  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_product   The proof can be broken down into two pieces.  (Pieces involving general properties of the integral of `sin x ^n` can be found  in `analysis.special_functions.integrals`.) First, we use integration by parts to obtain a  recursive formula for `‚à´ x in 0..œÄ, sin x ^ (n + 2)` in terms of `‚à´ x in 0..œÄ, sin x ^ n`.  From this we can obtain closed form products of `‚à´ x in 0..œÄ, sin x ^ (2 * n)` and  `‚à´ x in 0..œÄ, sin x ^ (2 * n + 1)` via induction. Next, we study the behavior of the ratio  `‚à´ (x : ‚Ñù) in 0..œÄ, sin x ^ (2 * k + 1)) / ‚à´ (x : ‚Ñù) in 0..œÄ, sin x ^ (2 * k)` and prove that  it converges to one using the squeeze theorem. The final product for `œÄ` is obtained after some  algebraic manipulation.

 Let `Z, N` be types, let `R` be a metric space, let `Œ± : R` be a point and let `j : Z ‚Üí N ‚Üí R` be a function.  We aim to estimate how close we can get to `Œ±`, while staying in the image of `j`.  The points `j z a` of `R` in the image of `j` come with a "cost" equal to `d a`.  As we get closer to `Œ±` while staying in the image of `j`, we are interested in bounding the quantity `d a * dist Œ± (j z a)` from below by a strictly positive amount `1 / A`: the intuition is that approximating well `Œ±` with the points in the image of `j` should come at a high cost.  The hypotheses on the function `f : R ‚Üí R` provide us with sufficient conditions to ensure our goal. The first hypothesis is that `f` is Lipschitz at `Œ±`: this yields a bound on the distance. The second hypothesis is specific to the Liouville argument and provides the missing bound involving the cost function `d`.  This lemma collects the properties used in the proof of `exists_pos_real_of_irrational_root`. It is stated in more general form than needed: in the intended application, `Z = ‚Ñ§`, `N = ‚Ñï`, `R = ‚Ñù`, `d a = (a + 1) ^ f.nat_degree`, `j z a  = z / (a + 1)`, `f ‚àà ‚Ñ§[x]`, `Œ±` is an irrational root of `f`, `Œµ` is small, `M` is a bound on the Lipschitz constant of `f` near `Œ±`, `n` is the degree of the polynomial `f`.

 If `f` and `g` are two exact solutions of the same ODE, then the distance between them can't grow faster than exponentially. This is a simple corollary of Gr√∂nwall's inequality, and some people call this Gr√∂nwall's inequality too.

 The derivative of the zero section of the tangent bundle maps `‚ü®x, v‚ü©` to `‚ü®‚ü®x, 0‚ü©, ‚ü®v, 0‚ü©‚ü©`.  Note that, as currently framed, this is a statement in coordinates, thus reliant on the choice of the coordinate system we use on the tangent bundle.  However, the result itself is coordinate-dependent only to the extent that the coordinates determine a splitting of the tangent bundle.  Moreover, there is a canonical splitting at each point of the zero section (since there is a canonical horizontal space there, the tangent space to the zero section, in addition to the canonical vertical space which is the kernel of the derivative of the projection), and this canonical splitting is also the one that comes from the coordinates on the tangent bundle in our definitions. So this statement is not as crazy as it may seem.  TODO define splittings of vector bundles; state this result invariantly.

A version of Riesz lemma: given a strict closed subspace `F`, one may find an element of norm `‚â§ R` which is at distance  at least `1` of every element of `F`. Here, `R` is any given constant strictly larger than the norm of an element of norm `> 1`. For a version without an `R`, see `riesz_lemma`.  Since we are considering a general nondiscrete normed field, there may be a gap in possible norms (for instance no element of norm in `(1,2)`). Hence, we can not allow `R` arbitrarily close to `1`, and require `R > ‚à•c‚à•` for some `c : ùïú` with norm `> 1`.

Shows the correctness of `comp_exact_value` in case the continued fraction `generalized_continued_fraction.of v` did not terminate at position `n`. That is, we obtain the value `v` if we pass the two successive (auxiliary) continuants at positions `n` and `n + 1` as well as the fractional part at `int_fract_pair.stream n` to `comp_exact_value`.  The correctness might be seen more readily if one uses `convergents'` to evaluate the continued fraction. Here is an example to illustrate the idea:  Let `(v : ‚Ñö) := 3.4`. We have - `generalized_continued_fraction.int_fract_pair.stream v 0 = some ‚ü®3, 0.4‚ü©`, and - `generalized_continued_fraction.int_fract_pair.stream v 1 = some ‚ü®2, 0.5‚ü©`. Now `(generalized_continued_fraction.of v).convergents' 1 = 3 + 1/2`, and our fractional term at position `2` is `0.5`. We hence have `v = 3 + 1/(2 + 0.5) = 3 + 1/2.5 = 3.4`. This computation corresponds exactly to the one using the recurrence equation in `comp_exact_value`.

`z - (to_zmod z : ‚Ñ§_[p])` is contained in the maximal ideal of `‚Ñ§_[p]`, for every `z : ‚Ñ§_[p]`.  The coercion from `zmod p` to `‚Ñ§_[p]` is `zmod.has_coe_t`, which coerces `zmod p` into artibrary rings. This is unfortunate, but a consequence of the fact that we allow `zmod p` to coerce to rings of arbitrary characteristic, instead of only rings of characteristic `p`. This coercion is only a ring homomorphism if it coerces into a ring whose characteristic divides `p`. While this is not the case here we can still make use of the coercion.

 Induction principle for matrices based on transvections: if a property is true for all diagonal matrices, all transvections, and is stable under product, then it is true for all matrices. This is the useful way to say that matrices are generated by diagonal matrices and transvections.

This is useful to obtain similar principles for `SL‚Çô` or `GL‚Çô`.

 This is a useful lemma to prove that a certain operation preserves functions being `C^n`. When you do induction on `n`, this gives a useful characterization of a function being `C^(n+1)`, assuming you have already computed the derivative. The advantage of this version over `cont_diff_succ_iff_fderiv` is that both occurences of `cont_diff` are for functions with the same domain and codomain (`E` and `F`). This is not the case for `cont_diff_succ_iff_fderiv`, which often requires an inconvenient need to generalize `F`, which results in universe issues (see the discussion in the section of `cont_diff.comp`).  This lemma avoids these universe issues, but only applies for finite dimensional `E`.
