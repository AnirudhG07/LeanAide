1. Use `$` to enclose LaTeX formulas.
2. If equations are being referred with symbols or numbers, retain the symbols or numbers within the proof.
3. Do not use previously written fractions/expressions as references for upcoming steps for initial proof extraction. Interpret fractions/expressions at each step.
4. The generated proof will be used to CHECK the correctness of the original proof, so DO NOT make corrections, add unmentioned reasonings complete proofs, only clean up the language.
