## Theorem
The product of two consecutive natural numbers is even
## Proof
Let \( n \) be a natural number. Consecutive natural numbers can be represented as \( n \) and \( n + 1 \).

Consider the product \( n(n + 1) \).

- If \( n \) is even, then \( n = 2k \) for some integer \( k \). Thus,
  \[
  n(n + 1) = (2k)(2k + 1) = 2k(2k + 1),
  \]
  which is even because it is a multiple of 2.

- If \( n \) is odd, then \( n = 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \). Thus,
  \[
  n(n + 1) = (2k + 1)(2k + 1 + 1) = (2k + 1)(2k + 2) = (2k + 1)(2k + 2),
  \]
  which simplifies to
  \[
  2(k + 1)(2k + 1),
  \]
  which is even because it is a multiple of 2.

In both cases, \( n(n + 1) \) is even. Thus, the product of two consecutive natural numbers is always even.
