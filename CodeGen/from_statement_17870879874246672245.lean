## Theorem
The product of two odd numbers is odd
## Proof
Let \( a \) and \( b \) be two odd numbers. By definition of odd numbers, there exist integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( a = 2m + 1 \) and \( b = 2n + 1 \).

Consider the product \( ab \):
\[
ab = (2m + 1)(2n + 1)
\]

Expanding the product, we have:
\[
ab = 4mn + 2m + 2n + 1
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
ab = 2(2mn + m + n) + 1
\]

Let \( k = 2mn + m + n \), which is an integer. Thus, we can express \( ab \) as:
\[
ab = 2k + 1
\]

This shows that \( ab \) is of the form \( 2k + 1 \), which is the definition of an odd number. Therefore, the product \( ab \) is odd.

Manually carrying out the localization of sorry terms in the proof term (because easily fixable bugs blocked the automatic one).

The following goals were left unsolved:

* `∀ {a b m : ℤ} {n : ℤ}, Odd a → Odd b → a = 2 * m + 1, ∀ {a b : ℤ} {m : ℤ} {n : ℤ}, Odd a → Odd b → b = 2 * n + 1`
* `(∀ {a b m n : ℤ}, Odd a → Odd b → a = 2 * m + 1 ∧ b = 2 * n + 1) → (∀ {m n : ℤ}`
* `Odd (2 * m + 1) → Odd (2 * n + 1) → (2 * m + 1) * (2 * n + 1) = 4 * m * n + 2 * m + 2 * n + 1) → ∀ {m n : ℤ}`
* `Odd m → Odd n → ∃ k, 4 * m * n + 2 * m + 2 * n = 2 * k`
