Let's assume for contradiction that there are only finitely many prime numbers ending in 7. List these primes as \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \), where each \( p_i \) ends in 7.

Consider the following number:
\[ N = 10 \cdot (p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n) + 7. \]

This number \( N \) ends in 7 and is therefore not divisible by 2 or 5. By construction, \( N \) is not divisible by any of the primes \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \), since dividing \( N \) by any \( p_i \) yields a remainder of 7.

Since \( N \) is greater than 1 and is not divisible by any of the primes ending in 7 that we assumed to be the complete list, \( N \) must either be a prime ending in 7 itself or have a prime factor ending in 7 that is not in our original list.

In either case, this contradicts the assumption that there are only finitely many primes ending in 7. Therefore, there must be infinitely many prime numbers ending in 7.
