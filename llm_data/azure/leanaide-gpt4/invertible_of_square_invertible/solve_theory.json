    "In order for a matrix $A$ to be invertible, there must exist a matrix $B$ such that $AB = BA = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. \n\nSuppose $A^2$ is invertible, then it has an inverse, say $(A^2)^{-1}$. \n\nWe need to show that $A$ has an inverse.

    "Theorem:\nIf $A^2$ is an invertible square matrix, then $A$ is also invertible.\n\nProof:\nAssume $A^2$ is invertible. Then, there exists a matrix, $(A^2)^{-1}$, such that $A^2(A^2)^{-1} = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nIt is to be shown that $A$ has an inverse. Let's propose $A(A^2)^{-1}$ as the inverse of $A$. \n\nTo confirm this, we need to check that:\n\n1. $A \\cdot A(A^2)^{-1} = I$\n2. $A(A^2)^{-1} \\cdot A = I$\n\nFrom the first equation, $A \\cdot A(A^2)^{-1} = A^2 (A^2)^{-1} = I$ holds.\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation, $A(A^2)^{-1} \\cdot A = A^2 (A^2)^{-1} = I$ also holds.\n\nThus, the matrix $A$ is invertible, with the inverse as $A(A^2)^{-1}$. This completes the proof.",
    "**Theorem:** If $A$ is a square matrix and $A^2$ is invertible, then $A$ is invertible.\n\n**Proof:** Assume that $A^2$ is invertible. This implies that there is a matrix $B$ such that $A^2B = BA^2 = I$.\n\nWe now assert that $BA$ is the inverse of $A$. To establish this, we perform the multiplication of $A$ and $BA$ from both sides:\n\nWe first multiply on the right, yielding $A(BA) = (AB)A = A^2B = I$. \n\nNext, we multiply on the left, giving $(BA)A = B(AA) = BA^2 = BI = B$.\n\nTherefore, these calculations lead to the conclusion that $A$ has an inverse, namely, $BA$. Hence, $A$ is invertible. The theorem is thus proven.",
    "Theorem: If a square matrix $A$ is such that $A^2$ is invertible, then $A$ is also invertible.\n\nProof: Suppose that $A^2$ is invertible. Then by definition, there exists a matrix $B$ such that $A^2B = BA^2 = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nWe need to establish the existence of a matrix $C$ such that $AC = CA = I$ in order to show that $A$ is invertible. Let us consider $C = ABA$. \n\nWe have $AC = A(ABA) = A^2B = I$. For $CA$, we have $CA = (ABA)A = AB(A^2) = ABI = A$, which completes the proof."
