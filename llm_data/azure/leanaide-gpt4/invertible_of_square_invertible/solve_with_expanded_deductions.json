    "**Theorem:** If $A$ is a square matrix and $A^2$ is invertible, then $A$ is invertible.\n\n**Proof:** \nSuppose $A^2$ is invertible. This implies the existence of a matrix $B$ such that $A^2B = BA^2 = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\nNotice that we can rewrite the equation $A^2B = I$ as $A(AB) = I$. This implies that the matrix $AB$ behaves as the inverse of $A$, since by definition of the inverse of a matrix, $A*A^{-1} = I$.\nHence, we conclude that $A$ is invertible. QED.\n",
    "Theorem: If the square of a square matrix is invertible, then the matrix itself is also invertible.\n\nProof: Assume that $A$ is a square matrix and $B = A^2$. Given that $B$ is invertible, there exists a matrix $B^{-1}$ such that $BB^{-1} = B^{-1}B = I$. \n\nSubstituting $B = A^2 = AA$ into these equations results in $AAB^{-1} = B^{-1}AA = I$. \n\nBy defining $C = AB^{-1}$, we obtain $AC = CA = I$. Therefore, $C$ serves as the inverse of $A$, which confirms that $A$ is indeed invertible. This completes the proof.",
    "Theorem: If $A^2$ is invertible for a square matrix $A$, then $A$ is invertible.\n\nProof: \nAssume $A^2$ is invertible. Consequently, there exists a matrix $B$ such that $A^2B=BA^2=I$, with $I$ being the identity matrix.\n\nFirst, consider the equation $A^2B=I$. Multiply both sides of this equation by $A$ on the left, yielding $A(A^2B)=(AA^2)B=A^3B$. Since $A^2B=I$, we have $A^3B=AI$, which simplifies to $A$. Therefore, we arrive at $AB=A$.\n\nSecond, examine the equation $BA^2=I$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $A$ on the right yields $B(AA^2)=(BA^2)A=B(A^3)$. Replacing $A^2$ with $I$ again, we get $B(A^3)=BI$, which simplifies to $B$. Therefore, we have $BA=B$.\n\nFrom the above, $A$ has a two-sided inverse $B$, hence $A$ is invertible."

    "The `ProofJSON` format you've provided doesn't seem to include any direct references to specific theorems in the `deduced_from` list. However, I can provide a general approach for checking whether the `claim` follows from the `deduced_from` results and how you might expand on the deduced theorems.\n\n1. For each `assertion`, iterate through its `deduced_from` list.\n2. For each entry in `deduced_from`, look up the corresponding theorem or definition.\n3. Check whether all conditions of the theorem are satisfied by the current context.\n   - If no, add an `error` field to the `assertion` with a description of the unsatisfied condition.\n   - If yes, build a new JSON object for the theorem, including the `name`, `statement`, `applied-to` (mapping from the theorem's variables to the terms in the current context), and `assumptions-satisfied` (a list of assumptions that were satisfied in order for the theorem to be applied).\n4. Replace the original entry in `deduced_from` with this new JSON object.\n\nHere's a pseudocode example for how this might look:\n\n```\nfor assertion in theorem['proof']:\n  if assertion['type'] == 'assertion':\n    new_deduced_from = []\n    for deduced_from in assertion['deduced_from']:\n      theorem = get_theorem(deduced_from)\n      if not theorem_satisfied(theorem, assertion):\n        assertion['error'] = f\"Theorem {theorem['name']} not satisfied\"\n        continue\n      new_deduced_from.append({\n        \"name\": theorem['name'],\n        \"statement\": theorem['statement'],\n        \"applied-to\": get_applied_to(theorem, assertion),\n        \"assumptions-satisfied\": get_assumptions_satisfied(theorem, assertion)\n      })\n    assertion['deduced_from'] = new_deduced_from\n```\n\nPlease note that the functions `get_theorem`, `theorem_satisfied`, `get_applied_to`, and `get_assumptions_satisfied` are placeholders and would need to be implemented according to your specific needs.",
    "Unfortunately, `ProofJSON` format is hypothetical and not a known standard, so I cannot process it in the way you requested. But, I can show you how to handle similar situations in a more standard context, like while working with Lean 4 theorem prover.\n\nIn Lean 4, each theorem or lemma will be a stand-alone statement that is proved from other known facts, assumptions, or previously proved theorems. It's up to the coder to ensure that the logical deductions are valid. Lean 4 itself is designed to check that all steps are logically valid and that the assumptions are satisfied for each step.\n\nFor example, consider this Lean 4 code:\n\n```Lean\nimport algebra.group\n\nvariables (G : Type*) [group G] (H : set G) [is_subgroup H] (n : ℕ)\n\ntheorem order_divides_card_group : fintype.card H ∣ fintype.card G :=\nby apply is_subgroup.card_subgroup_dvd_card\n\n#check order_divides_card_group\n```\n\nIn this case, `order_divides_card_group` is a theorem about subgroups, stating that the order of a subgroup `H` divides the order of the group `G`. The assumptions for this theorem are that `H` is a subgroup of `G` and both `H` and `G` are finite (`fintype`).\n\nThe Lean 4 system ensures that the theorem is validly deduced from the assumptions, and if we wanted to use this theorem later, we would need to supply a subgroup and a group that satisfy the conditions. \n\nIn general, while working with Lean 4, the coder's skill, understanding, and the Lean 4 system itself ensure the logical validity of theorems and their applications.",
    "The given JSON object represents a proof of the \"Matrix Invertibility Theorem\". Let's go through each `assertion` object.\n\n1. The first `assertion` has the `claim`: \"Substituting B = A^2 = AA into these equations results in AAB^-1 = B^-1AA = I\". The `deduced_from` fields are \"B = A^2\" and \"BB^-1 = B^-1B = I\". This claim indeed follows from these results as per the provided `justification`, so there is no need to add an `error` field. As for expanding the `deduced_from` list, this seems to be based on direct substitution rather than the application of a specific theorem, so it might not be feasible in this case.\n\n2. The second `assertion` has the `claim`: \"AC = CA = I\". The `deduced_from` fields are \"C = AB^-1\" and \"AAB^-1 = B^-1AA = I\". This claim indeed follows from these results as per the provided `justification`, so again, there is no need to add an `error` field. As for expanding the `deduced_from` list, again this seems to be based on direct substitution and multiplication, not the application of a specific theorem.\n\n3. The third `assertion` has the `claim`: \"A is invertible\". The `deduced_from` field is \"AC = CA = I\". This claim indeed follows from this result as per the provided `justification` and the definition of invertibility, so there is no need to add an `error` field. As for expanding the `deduced_from` list, again this seems to be based on the definition of invertibility, not the application of a specific theorem.\n\nSo in this case, we wouldn't add any `error` fields, and we wouldn't be able to expand the `deduced_from` lists as described because the `assertions` in this proof don't seem to be based on the application of specific theorems but on direct algebraic manipulations and definitions.",

    "Your instruction involves manipulating a JSON schema and is not directly related to Lean 4 or mathematical theorems in Lean 4. However, I can guide you on how you might approach this problem in a general programming context.\n\nYou will need to iterate over each object in the JSON schema, checking each object's type. If the type is \"assertion\", you will need to verify whether the claim made in the assertion follows logically from the results listed in the object's \"deduced_from\" field. This process will involve applying logical reasoning, and depending on the complexity of the reasoning involved, may require complex algorithmic or even AI-based processes.\n\nIf the claim does not follow from the results, you would add an \"error\" field to the object with a description of the error. This could be done in most programming languages with a simple assignment operation, setting the \"error\" field of the object to the desired error message.\n\nIf the claim does follow from the results, your task is to expand each result in the \"deduced_from\" field into an object with the fields \"name\", \"statement\", \"applied-to\", and \"assumptions-satisfied\". This will involve looking up each result in a database or other source of information where the details of the result (its name, statement, and any assumptions it relies on) can be found.\n\nOnce these details are obtained, they can be used to form the expanded object. The \"applied-to\" field would map the variables in the result's statement to the corresponding elements in the original claim, while the \"assumptions-satisfied\" field would list any assumptions listed in the result's details that are confirmed to be satisfied.\n\nThis process would be repeated for each result in the \"deduced_from\" field, replacing the original result with the newly-formed object. \n\nAgain, this is a general description of what you might do in a typical programming language, and the specific code would depend on the language and the libraries you're using.",
    "I will analyze the assertions in your `ProofJSON` to verify if the claims indeed follow from the `deduced_from` results.\n\n1. Assertion 1:\n    - Claim: \"AB=A\"\n    - Deduced from: \"A^2B=I\"\n    - After applying the multiplication by A on both sides, the equation becomes \"A^3B=A\", which simplifies to \"AB=A\" after replacing \"A^2\" with \"I\". Hence, the claim follows from the `deduced_from` result.\n\n    Expanded `deduced_from` object:\n    ```\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Matrix multiplication\",\n        \"statement\": \"If A^2B=I for some B, then multiplying both sides by A yields A(A^2B)=A\",\n        \"applied-to\": {\"A\": \"A\", \"B\": \"B\"},\n        \"assumptions-satisfied\": [\"A^2 is invertible\", \"A^2B=I\"]\n    }\n    ```\n    \n\n2. Assertion 2:\n    - Claim: \"BA=B\"\n    - Deduced from: \"BA^2=I\"\n    - After applying the multiplication by A on the right side, the equation becomes \"B(A^3)=B\", which simplifies to \"BA=B\" after replacing \"A^2\" with \"I\". Hence, the claim follows from the `deduced_from` result.\n\n    Expanded `deduced_from` object:\n    ```\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Matrix multiplication\",\n        \"statement\": \"If BA^2=I for some B, then multiplying both sides by A yields B(AA^2)=B\",\n        \"applied-to\": {\"A\": \"A\", \"B\": \"B\"},\n        \"assumptions-satisfied\": [\"A^2 is invertible\", \"BA^2=I\"]\n    }\n    ```\n\nIn conclusion, all assertions in this `ProofJSON` are correct, and the claims indeed follow from the results in `deduced_from`. The theorem \"A square invertible implies A invertible\" is correctly proved in this `ProofJSON`."
