    "**Theorem:** If $A$ is a square matrix and $A^2$ is invertible, then $A$ is invertible.\n\n**Proof:** \nSuppose $A^2$ is invertible. This implies the existence of a matrix $B$ such that $A^2B = BA^2 = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\nNotice that we can rewrite the equation $A^2B = I$ as $A(AB) = I$. This implies that the matrix $AB$ behaves as the inverse of $A$, since by definition of the inverse of a matrix, $A*A^{-1} = I$.\nHence, we conclude that $A$ is invertible. QED.\n",
    "Theorem: If the square of a square matrix is invertible, then the matrix itself is also invertible.\n\nProof: Assume that $A$ is a square matrix and $B = A^2$. Given that $B$ is invertible, there exists a matrix $B^{-1}$ such that $BB^{-1} = B^{-1}B = I$. \n\nSubstituting $B = A^2 = AA$ into these equations results in $AAB^{-1} = B^{-1}AA = I$. \n\nBy defining $C = AB^{-1}$, we obtain $AC = CA = I$. Therefore, $C$ serves as the inverse of $A$, which confirms that $A$ is indeed invertible. This completes the proof.",
    "Theorem: If $A^2$ is invertible for a square matrix $A$, then $A$ is invertible.\n\nProof: \nAssume $A^2$ is invertible. Consequently, there exists a matrix $B$ such that $A^2B=BA^2=I$, with $I$ being the identity matrix.\n\nFirst, consider the equation $A^2B=I$. Multiply both sides of this equation by $A$ on the left, yielding $A(A^2B)=(AA^2)B=A^3B$. Since $A^2B=I$, we have $A^3B=AI$, which simplifies to $A$. Therefore, we arrive at $AB=A$.\n\nSecond, examine the equation $BA^2=I$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $A$ on the right yields $B(AA^2)=(BA^2)A=B(A^3)$. Replacing $A^2$ with $I$ again, we get $B(A^3)=BI$, which simplifies to $B$. Therefore, we have $BA=B$.\n\nFrom the above, $A$ has a two-sided inverse $B$, hence $A$ is invertible."
