    "Theorem:\nIf $A^2$ is an invertible square matrix, then $A$ is also invertible.\n\nProof:\nAssume $A^2$ is invertible. Then, there exists a matrix, $(A^2)^{-1}$, such that $A^2(A^2)^{-1} = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nIt is to be shown that $A$ has an inverse.

    "**Theorem:** If $A$ is a square matrix and $A^2$ is invertible, then $A$ is invertible.\n\n**Proof:** Assume that $A^2$ is invertible. This implies that there is a matrix $B$ such that $A^2B = BA^2 = I$.\n\nWe now assert that $BA$ is the inverse of $A$. To establish this, we perform the multiplication of $A$ and $BA$ from both sides:\n\nWe first multiply on the right, yielding $A(BA) = (AB)A = A^2B = I$. \n\nNext, we multiply on the left, giving $(BA)A = B(AA) = BA^2 = BI = B$.\n\nTherefore, these calculations lead to the conclusion that $A$ has an inverse, namely, $BA$. Hence, $A$ is invertible. The theorem is thus proven.",
