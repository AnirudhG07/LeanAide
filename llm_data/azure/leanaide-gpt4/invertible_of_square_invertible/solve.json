    "Assume $A^2$ is invertible. Then there exists a matrix $B$ such that $A^2B = BA^2 = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nConsider the product $A(AB)$. We have:\n\n$A(AB) = A^2B = I$.\n\nSo $AB = B' = A^{-1}$, where $B'$ is the inverse of $A$.\n\nThus, $A$ is invertible.",
    "Let's denote $B = A^2$. Since $B$ is invertible, there exists a matrix $B^{-1}$ such that $BB^{-1} = B^{-1}B = I$.\n\nWe know that $B = A^2 = AA$, so we can write the previous expressions as $AAB^{-1} = B^{-1}AA = I$. \n\nLet's take $C = AB^{-1}$. Then we have $AC = CA = I$, so $C$ is the inverse of $A$, which means $A$ is invertible.",
    "Suppose $A^2$ is invertible. This means there exists a matrix $B$ such that $A^2B=BA^2=I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nMultiplying both sides of $A^2B=I$ by $A$ from the left gives $A(A^2B)=(AA^2)B=A^3B=AI=A$ (because $A^2B=I$). Therefore, $AB=A$.\n\nSimilarly, multiplying both sides of $BA^2=I$ by $A$ from the right gives $B(AA^2)=(BA^2)A=B(A^3)=BI=B$, so $BA=B$.\n\nThus, $A$ has a two-sided inverse (namely $B$), so $A$ is invertible."
