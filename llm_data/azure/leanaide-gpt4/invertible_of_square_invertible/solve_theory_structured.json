    "Theorem:\nIf $A^2$ is an invertible square matrix, then $A$ is also invertible.\n\nProof:\nAssume $A^2$ is invertible. Then, there exists a matrix, $(A^2)^{-1}$, such that $A^2(A^2)^{-1} = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nIt is to be shown that $A$ has an inverse.

    "**Theorem:** If $A$ is a square matrix and $A^2$ is invertible, then $A$ is invertible.\n\n**Proof:** Assume that $A^2$ is invertible. This implies that there is a matrix $B$ such that $A^2B = BA^2 = I$.\n\nWe now assert that $BA$ is the inverse of $A$. To establish this, we perform the multiplication of $A$ and $BA$ from both sides:\n\nWe first multiply on the right, yielding $A(BA) = (AB)A = A^2B = I$. \n\nNext, we multiply on the left, giving $(BA)A = B(AA) = BA^2 = BI = B$.\n\nTherefore, these calculations lead to the conclusion that $A$ has an inverse, namely, $BA$. Hence, $A$ is invertible. The theorem is thus proven.",

The proof follows, first introducing the assumption that A^2 is invertible. We then define matrix B in accordance with this assumption. Next, we introduce matrix C, defined as ABA. Finally, we assert the required property of matrix C, justifying it based on the properties of matrix B and the definition of matrix C.",
    "Here is the `ProofJSON` representation for the given proof.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"theorem\",\n    \"name\": \"sq_matrix_inv\",\n    \"statement\": \"If a square matrix A is such that A^2 is invertible, then A is also invertible.\",\n    \"status\": \"proved\",\n    \"proof\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"assumption\",\n        \"statement\": \"A^2 is invertible.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"definition\",\n        \"statement\": \"A square matrix is invertible if and only if there exists a matrix B such that AB = BA = I, where I is the identity matrix.\",\n        \"term\": \"invertible matrix\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"let\",\n        \"variable\": \"B\",\n        \"value\": \"matrix such that A^2B = BA^2 = I\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"let\",\n        \"variable\": \"C\",\n        \"value\": \"ABA\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"assertion\",\n        \"claim\": \"AC = A(ABA) = A^2B = I\",\n        \"deduced-from\": [\n          {\n            \"result\": \"definition of C\",\n            \"applied-to\": \"A\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"result\": \"definition of B\",\n            \"applied-to\": \"A^2\"\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"assertion\",\n        \"claim\": \"CA = (ABA)A = AB(A^2) = ABI = A\",\n        \"deduced-from\": [\n          {\n            \"result\": \"definition of C\",\n            \"applied-to\": \"A\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"result\": \"definition of B\",\n            \"applied-to\": \"A^2\"\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"observation\",\n        \"statement\": \"Hence, matrix A is invertible.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis `ProofJSON` first states the theorem and then provides a proof. The proof begins with an assumption followed by a definition. Then, it introduces two new variables (B and C). The assertions demonstrate the properties of these variables, followed by an observation indicating the completion of the proof."
