Then $f$ is not necessarily unbounded.\n\n## Proof\nTake $f(x) = x^2$ as a counterexample. This function is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$ and its second derivative is $f''(x) = 2 > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. However, $f$ is not unbounded. Thus, the original statement is false.\n\n## Theorem 2\nIf $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function and $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is unbounded above.\n\n## Proof\nConsider again the function $f(x) = x^2$. As $x \\rightarrow +\\infty$, $f(x) \\rightarrow +\\infty$. Therefore, $f$ is unbounded above.\n\n## Theorem 3\nIf $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function and $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ may be bounded below.\n\n## Proof\nIn our example function $f(x) = x^2$, we have $f(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Hence, $f$ is bounded below and the statement is true.",

Therefore, if f''(x) > 0 for all x in R, then f is strictly convex.\n\n## Theorem 2\nIf a function f:R→R is strictly convex, then f is unbounded.\n\n## Proof\nBy the properties of convex functions, a strictly convex function cannot be bounded. Hence, if f is strictly convex, then f is unbounded."
