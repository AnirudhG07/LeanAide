    "The condition $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ implies that $f$ is strictly convex. A strictly convex function cannot be bounded from above or below. \n\nTo see why, consider two cases:\n\n1. Suppose $f$ is bounded above by some $M \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Because $f$ is continuous, by the extreme value theorem, there exists some $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_0)=M$. However, since $f$ is strictly convex, for any $h>0$, we have $f(x_0+h) > f(x_0) = M$ and $f(x_0-h) > f(x_0) = M$, contradicting that $f$ is bounded above.\n\n2. Suppose $f$ is bounded below by some $m \\in \\mathbb{R}$. By a similar argument using the strict convexity of $f$, we can find a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, $f$ is unbounded.",
    "The statement is false.\n\nFor example, consider $f(x) = x^2$. We have $f''(x) = 2 > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, yet $f$ is bounded below by $0$. \n\nThe property $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x$ means that $f$ is strictly convex, not that $f$ is unbounded."

    "**Theorem 1:** If $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function such that $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is unbounded.\n\n**Proof:** \n\nAssume the contrary, that $f$ is bounded. Then there exist $m,M \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $m \\leq f(x) \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x$, $f$ is strictly concave up. Therefore, $f$ has at most one local minimum. \n\nCase 1: $f$ has a local minimum at $x=c$. Then $f(x) \\geq f(c)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Because $f$ is bounded, $f(x) \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and $f(c) \\leq M$. But as $f$ is strictly concave up, $f(x)$ tends to infinity as $x$ tends to both $-\\infty$ and $+\\infty$, contradicting the assumption that $f$ is bounded above.\n\nCase 2: $f$ has no local minimum, i.e., $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing or strictly increasing for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSubcase 2a: $f$ is strictly decreasing. Then $f(x)$ tends to negative infinity as $x$ tends to $+\\infty$, contradicting the assumption that $f$ is bounded below.\n\nSubcase 2b: $f$ is strictly increasing. In this case, $f(x)$ tends to positive infinity as $x$ tends to $+\\infty$, which contradicts the assumption that $f$ is bounded above.\n\nBy contradiction, $f$ must be unbounded.",

    "Theorem 1: If $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function such that $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is strictly convex.\n\nProof: Suppose $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function and $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. If $x < y < z$, then by the Mean Value Theorem, there exist points $c_1$ in $(x,y)$ and $c_2$ in $(y,z)$ such that $f'(c_1)=(f(y)-f(x))/(y-x)$ and $f'(c_2)=(f(z)-f(y))/(z-y)$. Since $f''(x) > 0$, then $f'(x)$ is strictly increasing, so $f'(c_1) < f'(c_2)$. Hence, $(f(y)-f(x))/(y-x) < (f(z)-f(y))/(z-y)$, which implies $f(y) < ((z-y)f(x)+(y-x)f(z))/(z-x)$. So, $f$ is strictly convex.\n\nTheorem 2: A continuous and strictly convex function $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is not guaranteed to be unbounded.\n\nCounterexample: Consider $f(x) = x^2$. We have $f''(x) = 2 > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, so $f$ is strictly convex. However, $f$ is bounded below by $0$, demonstrating that strict convexity does not imply unboundedness."
