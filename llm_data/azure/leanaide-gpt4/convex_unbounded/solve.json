  "solutions": [
    "Assume for contradiction that $f$ is bounded. Then there exist $m,M \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $m \\leq f(x) \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x$, it follows that $f$ is strictly concave up. Thus, $f$ has at most one local minimum. \n\nIf $f$ has a local minimum at $x=c$, then $f(x) \\geq f(c)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $f$ is bounded, there exists $M$ such that $f(x) \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $f(c) \\leq M$. \n\nBut then, because $f$ is strictly concave up, it must be that $f(x)$ tends to infinity as $x$ tends to both $-\\infty$ and $+\\infty$, which contradicts the assumption that $f$ is bounded above.\n\nIf $f$ has no local minimum, then $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing or strictly increasing for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIf $f$ is strictly decreasing, then it must be that $f(x)$ tends to negative infinity as $x$ tends to $+\\infty$, which contradicts the assumption that $f$ is bounded below.\n\nIf $f$ is strictly increasing, then it must be that $f(x)$ tends to positive infinity as $x$ tends to $+\\infty$, which contradicts the assumption that $f$ is bounded above.\n\nTherefore, $f$ must be unbounded. \nThis contradiction completes the proof.",
    "The condition $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ implies that $f$ is strictly convex. A strictly convex function cannot be bounded from above or below. \n\nTo see why, consider two cases:\n\n1. Suppose $f$ is bounded above by some $M \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Because $f$ is continuous, by the extreme value theorem, there exists some $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_0)=M$. However, since $f$ is strictly convex, for any $h>0$, we have $f(x_0+h) > f(x_0) = M$ and $f(x_0-h) > f(x_0) = M$, contradicting that $f$ is bounded above.\n\n2. Suppose $f$ is bounded below by some $m \\in \\mathbb{R}$. By a similar argument using the strict convexity of $f$, we can find a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, $f$ is unbounded.",
    "The statement is false.\n\nFor example, consider $f(x) = x^2$. We have $f''(x) = 2 > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, yet $f$ is bounded below by $0$. \n\nThe property $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x$ means that $f$ is strictly convex, not that $f$ is unbounded."
