    "Suppose $f$ were bounded. Then the Extreme Value Theorem implies that there exist points $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(a) = \\inf_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} f(x)$ and $f(b) = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} f(x)$. \n\nNow, since $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, this means $f$ is strictly convex. A strictly convex function achieves its infimum and supremum at the endpoints of the interval. But since the domain is $\\mathbb{R}$, there are no endpoints, which contradicts the existence of $a$ and $b$. Therefore, $f$ must be unbounded.",
    "The assumption that $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ implies that $f$ is strictly convex. \n\nConsider the limit as $x$ approaches $\\infty$. If $f(x)$ were to approach a finite limit as $x \\rightarrow \\infty$, then by the definition of limit, for some sufficiently large $x$, $f(x)$ would be arbitrarily close to that limit, say $L$. But then, given the strict convexity of $f$, for any $x' > x$, $f(x') > f(x)$, which contradicts the assumption that $f(x)$ is close to $L$. Hence, $f(x)$ is unbounded as $x \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nA similar argument can be made for $x \\rightarrow -\\infty$. Hence, $f$ is unbounded.",
    "Assume for contradiction that $f$ is bounded. Then, there exist real numbers $M$ and $m$ such that $m \\leq f(x) \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the function $f$ is strictly convex. Then, by the characterization of convex functions, for any $x<y<z$ we have\n\n$$\\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x} \\leq \\frac{f(z)-f(y)}{z-y}.$$\n\nLetting $y \\to x^+$ and $y \\to z^-$, we can conclude that $f'$ is nondecreasing.\n\nSuppose there exist $a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f'(a)<0$ and $f'(b)>0$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem (since $f'$ is nondecreasing and hence continuous), for every $c \\in (f'(a),f'(b))$, there exists $d \\in (a,b)$ such that $f'(d)=c$. Therefore, $f'$ takes both negative and positive values, contradicting the assumption that $f$ is bounded.\n\nHence, we must have $f'(x) \\leq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ or $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. However, both these cases would contradict the property that $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, leading to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, this contradiction shows that our initial assumption that $f$ is bounded must be false. Hence, $f$ is unbounded."
