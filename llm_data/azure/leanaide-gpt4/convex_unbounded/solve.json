    "The statement is false. The function $f(x) = x^2$ is a counterexample. It is continuous, its second derivative is positive for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, but it is not unbounded. Its range is $[0, \\infty)$.",
    "The statement is false. Consider the function $f(x) = x^2$. It is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$ and its second derivative is $f''(x) = 2 > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. However, $f$ is not unbounded. Instead, it is unbounded only above (as $x \\rightarrow +\\infty$), but it is bounded below (specifically, $f(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$).",
    "The assumption $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ means that $f$ is a strictly convex function. From the properties of convex functions, we know that a strictly convex function cannot be bounded. Therefore, $f$ is unbounded."
