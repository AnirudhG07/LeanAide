But then, given the strict convexity of $f$, for any $x' > x$, $f(x') > f(x)$, which contradicts the assumption that $f(x)$ is close to $L$.

This implies that a strictly convex function can only achieve its infimum and supremum at the endpoints of its interval.\n\nHowever, the domain of $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}$, which has no endpoints.

    "Theorem 1: Suppose $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function such that $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then $f(x)$ is unbounded as $x \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nProof: If $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is strictly convex. Suppose $f(x)$ approaches a finite limit $L$ as $x \\rightarrow \\infty$. Then for some sufficiently large $x$, $f(x)$ is arbitrarily close to $L$. However, due to the strict convexity of $f$, for any $x' > x$, $f(x') > f(x)$, contradicting the assumption that $f(x)$ is close to $L$.

Then $f(x)$ is unbounded as $x \\rightarrow -\\infty$.\n\nProof: The proof is analogous to the proof of Theorem 1, but considering $x \\rightarrow -\\infty$. Again, we assume that $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, implying that $f$ is strictly convex. If $f(x)$ were to approach a finite limit $L$ as $x \\rightarrow -\\infty$, then for some sufficiently small $x$ (i.e., a large negative number), $f(x)$ would be arbitrarily close to $L$. However, due to the strict convexity of $f$, for any $x' < x$, $f(x') > f(x)$, contradicting the assumption that $f(x)$ is close to $L$. Therefore, $f(x)$ is unbounded as $x \\rightarrow -\\infty$.",
    "**Theorem 1:** If $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function and $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is strictly convex.\n\n**Proof:** The second derivative test for convexity states that if the second derivative of a function is positive at all points in its domain, then the function is strictly convex. Hence, if $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is strictly convex.\n\n**Theorem 2:** If $f$ is strictly convex, its derivative $f'$ is nondecreasing.\n\n**Proof:** By the characterization of convex functions, for any $x<y<z$, we have\n\n$$\\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x} \\leq \\frac{f(z)-f(y)}{z-y}.$$\n\nLetting $y \\to x^+$ and $y \\to z^-$, we conclude that $f'$ is nondecreasing.\n\n**Theorem 3:** If $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is unbounded.\n\n**Proof:** By contradiction, suppose $f$ is bounded. Then, by Theorem 1, $f$ is strictly convex and by Theorem 2, $f'$ is nondecreasing. Suppose there exist $a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f'(a)<0$ and $f'(b)>0$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, for every $c \\in (f'(a),f'(b))$, there exists $d \\in (a,b)$ such that $f'(d)=c$. This contradicts the assumption that $f$ is bounded.

For instance, in the proof of Theorem 3, the application of the Intermediate Value Theorem is specified in the \"deduced-from\" field for the claim that the boundedness of $f$ contradicts the nondecreasing nature of $f'$ and the positivity of $f''$.",
