    "The polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals. This is because it is a factor of the fifth cyclotomic polynomial $x^5 - 1 = 0$, which is known to be irreducible over the rationals. The factors of $x^5 - 1$ are $x - 1$ and $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ (by applying the factorization formula $x^n - 1 = (x - 1)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + \\cdots + x + 1)$ for $n = 5$). Since $x - 1$ is clearly irreducible, so must be our given polynomial."
