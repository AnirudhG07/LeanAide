    "Let $f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$. \n\nAssume by contradiction that $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, thus $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$ for some non-constant polynomials $g(x), h(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. \n\nNotice that $f(x)$ is a factor of $x^5 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)$. \n\nSince $x^5 - 1$ has distinct roots and $x - 1$ has degree 1, any non-constant divisor of $f(x)$ must also share a root with $f(x)$. \n\nHowever, the roots of $f(x)$ are the fifth roots of unity except $1$, which are not in $\\mathbb{Q}$. \n\nHence, $g(x), h(x)$ cannot have a root in $\\mathbb{Q}$, which contradicts that $g(x), h(x)$ are polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and non-constant since every non-constant polynomial over a field has a root in its algebraic closure.\n\nThus, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.",
    "The polynomial $p(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ can be written in the form $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0$. \n\nThis is equivalent to $x^5 - 1 = 0$, which has roots that are the 5th roots of unity. \n\nThese roots include $x = 1$ and the roots of the given polynomial.\n\nNow note that $p(x)$ is a factor of $x^5 - 1 = (x-1)p(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. \n\nSince the roots of $x^5 - 1$ are $1$, $\\omega$, $\\omega^2$, $\\omega^3$, $\\omega^4$ where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 5}$, and 1 is a root of $x-1$, the roots of $p(x)$ must be $\\omega$, $\\omega^2$, $\\omega^3$, $\\omega^4$.\n\nSince these roots are not in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the polynomial $p(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by the definition of an irreducible polynomial.",
    "Consider f(x) = $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$.\n\nWe will use the substitution $y = x + \\frac{1}{x}$, which gives us $y^2 = x^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}$. \n\nSubstituting $x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}$ with $y^2 - 2$ in $f(x)$, we get $f(x) = (y^2 - 2)^2 + y(y^2 - 2) + 1$.

    "Theorem: The polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\nProof: \nSuppose for contradiction that $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$ for some non-constant polynomials $g(x), h(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. \n\nObserve that $f(x)$ is a factor of $x^5 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)$. This polynomial $x^5 - 1$ has distinct roots and the polynomial $x - 1$ has degree 1. Thus, any non-constant divisor of $f(x)$ must also share a root with $f(x)$. \n\nThe roots of $f(x)$ are the fifth roots of unity except $1$, which are not rational. Therefore, neither $g(x)$ nor $h(x)$ can have a root in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nHowever, by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, $g(x)$ and $h(x)$, as non-constant polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$, must have a root in its algebraic closure, which is a contradiction.\n\nHence, our initial assumption must be false, and the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n",
    "Theorem: The polynomial $p(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nProof: Observe that the polynomial $p(x)$ can be obtained by factoring $x-1$ out of the polynomial $x^5 - 1 = 0$. That is, $x^5 - 1 = (x-1)p(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. \n\nNow, the roots of $x^5 - 1 = 0$ are the 5th roots of unity, which are $1$, $\\omega$, $\\omega^2$, $\\omega^3$, $\\omega^4$ where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 5}$. Among these roots, 1 is the root of $x-1$, so the roots of $p(x)$ must be the remaining roots of unity, that is, $\\omega$, $\\omega^2$, $\\omega^3$, $\\omega^4$.\n\nSince these roots are not rational, and a polynomial is irreducible over a field if and only if it has no roots in that field, we conclude that the polynomial $p(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.",
    "**Theorem 1:**  \nThe polynomial $y^4 - 3y^2 + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\n**Proof:**  \nWe use Eisenstein's criterion with prime p=3. The coefficients of $y^4 - 3y^2 + 1$ are not divisible by 3, the coefficient of the term $y^2$ is divisible by $3^2$ but not by $3^3$, and the constant term is not divisible by $3^2$. Thus, by Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial $y^4 - 3y^2 + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\n**Theorem 2:**  \nThe polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\n**Proof:**  \nConsider the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$. We introduce the substitution $y = x + \\frac{1}{x}$, which gives $y^2 = x^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}$. Substituting $x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}$ with $y^2 - 2$ in $f(x)$, we get $f(x) = (y^2 - 2)^2 + y(y^2 - 2) + 1 = y^4 - 3y^2 + 1$. From theorem 1, we know $y^4 - 3y^2 + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals. Thus, if $f(x)$ were reducible over the rationals, then $y^4 - 3y^2 + 1$ would also be reducible, which is a contradiction. Hence, $f(x)$ is irreducible over the rationals."
