    "Let $f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$. \n\nAssume by contradiction that $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, thus $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$ for some non-constant polynomials $g(x), h(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. \n\nNotice that $f(x)$ is a factor of $x^5 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)$. \n\nSince $x^5 - 1$ has distinct roots and $x - 1$ has degree 1, any non-constant divisor of $f(x)$ must also share a root with $f(x)$. \n\nHowever, the roots of $f(x)$ are the fifth roots of unity except $1$, which are not in $\\mathbb{Q}$. \n\nHence, $g(x), h(x)$ cannot have a root in $\\mathbb{Q}$, which contradicts that $g(x), h(x)$ are polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and non-constant since every non-constant polynomial over a field has a root in its algebraic closure.\n\nThus, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.",
    "The polynomial $p(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ can be written in the form $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0$. \n\nThis is equivalent to $x^5 - 1 = 0$, which has roots that are the 5th roots of unity. \n\nThese roots include $x = 1$ and the roots of the given polynomial.\n\nNow note that $p(x)$ is a factor of $x^5 - 1 = (x-1)p(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. \n\nSince the roots of $x^5 - 1$ are $1$, $\\omega$, $\\omega^2$, $\\omega^3$, $\\omega^4$ where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 5}$, and 1 is a root of $x-1$, the roots of $p(x)$ must be $\\omega$, $\\omega^2$, $\\omega^3$, $\\omega^4$.\n\nSince these roots are not in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the polynomial $p(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by the definition of an irreducible polynomial.",
    "Consider f(x) = $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$.\n\nWe will use the substitution $y = x + \\frac{1}{x}$, which gives us $y^2 = x^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}$. \n\nSubstituting $x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}$ with $y^2 - 2$ in $f(x)$, we get $f(x) = (y^2 - 2)^2 + y(y^2 - 2) + 1$. Expanding this expression, we get $y^4 - 3y^2 + 1$.\n\nIf $f(x)$ were reducible over the rationals, the polynomial in $y$, $y^4 - 3y^2 + 1$, would also be reducible. But using Eisenstein's criterion on $p = 3$, we see that $y^4 - 3y^2 + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\nTherefore, $f(x)$ is irreducible over the rationals."
