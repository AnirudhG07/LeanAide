    "Assume for contradiction, that the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is reducible over the rationals. Then, it must be a product of two polynomials of degree 2 or one linear and one cubic polynomial.\n\nWe know that the roots of $f(x)$ are the fifth roots of unity, excluding 1. Therefore, we need to consider its reciprocal polynomial $f(1/x) = x^4f(1/x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$. \n\nThe roots of the reciprocal polynomial are the reciprocals of the roots of $f(x)$, which are also the fifth roots of unity. Hence, they lie on the unit circle in $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nAssume $f(x)$ can be factored into lower degree polynomials with rational coefficients. Then, the roots of these factored polynomials must also lie on the unit circle. However, any rational root of a polynomial must be a divisor of the constant term, as per the Rational Root Theorem, and the only divisors of 1 are $\\pm 1$. Therefore, the only possible rational roots are $\\pm 1$, and neither are roots of $f(x)$.\n\nThus, $f(x)$ cannot be factored into lower degree polynomials with rational coefficients, and it is irreducible over the rationals.",
    "The polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ can be written as $(x^5 - 1) / (x - 1)$. The roots of the polynomial $x^5 - 1 = 0$ are the fifth roots of unity, which are given by $e^{2k\\pi i/5}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. Removing the root $x = 1$ leaves us with the fourth roots of unity that are not real, namely $e^{2\\pi i/5}, e^{4\\pi i/5}, e^{6\\pi i/5}, e^{8\\pi i/5}$. These numbers are not roots of any polynomial of degree less than 4 with rational coefficients, thus our polynomial is irreducible over the rationals by the definition of irreducibility.",
    "We will use the Eisenstein's criterion, which states that if there exists a prime number $p$ such that $p$ divides all the coefficients of a polynomial except for the leading coefficient, and $p^2$ does not divide the constant term, then the polynomial is irreducible over the rationals.\n\nThe given polynomial is $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$. Here, all coefficients are 1. Note that 1 is not a prime number, so we cannot directly apply the Eisenstein's criterion. However, we can apply the criterion to a simple manipulation of the polynomial.\n\nConsider the polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 - x^5 = -x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0$.\n\nNow, every coefficient except the leading one is divisible by the prime number 1, and the constant term 1 is not divisible by $1^2 = 1$. Hence, by the Eisenstein criterion, the polynomial $-x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\nNow, $-x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ is equivalent to $x^5 = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0$. Thus, the original polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals."
