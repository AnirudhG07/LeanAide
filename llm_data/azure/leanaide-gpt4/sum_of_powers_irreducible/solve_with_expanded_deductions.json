    "The polynomial $p(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ can be written in the form $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0$. \n\nThis is equivalent to $x^5 - 1 = 0$, which has roots that are the 5th roots of unity. \n\nThese roots include $x = 1$ and the roots of the given polynomial.\n\nNow note that $p(x)$ is a factor of $x^5 - 1 = (x-1)p(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. \n\nSince the roots of $x^5 - 1$ are $1$, $\\omega$, $\\omega^2$, $\\omega^3$, $\\omega^4$ where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 5}$, and 1 is a root of $x-1$, the roots of $p(x)$ must be $\\omega$, $\\omega^2$, $\\omega^3$, $\\omega^4$.\n\nSince these roots are not in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the polynomial $p(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by the definition of an irreducible polynomial.",

    "Theorem: The polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\nProof: \nSuppose for contradiction that $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$ for some non-constant polynomials $g(x), h(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. \n\nObserve that $f(x)$ is a factor of $x^5 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)$. This polynomial $x^5 - 1$ has distinct roots and the polynomial $x - 1$ has degree 1. Thus, any non-constant divisor of $f(x)$ must also share a root with $f(x)$. \n\nThe roots of $f(x)$ are the fifth roots of unity except $1$, which are not rational. Therefore, neither $g(x)$ nor $h(x)$ can have a root in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nHowever, by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, $g(x)$ and $h(x)$, as non-constant polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$, must have a root in its algebraic closure, which is a contradiction.\n\nHence, our initial assumption must be false, and the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n",
    "Theorem: The polynomial $p(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nProof: Observe that the polynomial $p(x)$ can be obtained by factoring $x-1$ out of the polynomial $x^5 - 1 = 0$. That is, $x^5 - 1 = (x-1)p(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. \n\nNow, the roots of $x^5 - 1 = 0$ are the 5th roots of unity, which are $1$, $\\omega$, $\\omega^2$, $\\omega^3$, $\\omega^4$ where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 5}$. Among these roots, 1 is the root of $x-1$, so the roots of $p(x)$ must be the remaining roots of unity, that is, $\\omega$, $\\omega^2$, $\\omega^3$, $\\omega^4$.\n\nSince these roots are not rational, and a polynomial is irreducible over a field if and only if it has no roots in that field, we conclude that the polynomial $p(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.",
    "**Theorem 1:**  \nThe polynomial $y^4 - 3y^2 + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\n**Proof:**  \nWe use Eisenstein's criterion with prime p=3. The coefficients of $y^4 - 3y^2 + 1$ are not divisible by 3, the coefficient of the term $y^2$ is divisible by $3^2$ but not by $3^3$, and the constant term is not divisible by $3^2$. Thus, by Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial $y^4 - 3y^2 + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\n**Theorem 2:**  \nThe polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\n**Proof:**  \nConsider the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$. We introduce the substitution $y = x + \\frac{1}{x}$, which gives $y^2 = x^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}$. Substituting $x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2}$ with $y^2 - 2$ in $f(x)$, we get $f(x) = (y^2 - 2)^2 + y(y^2 - 2) + 1 = y^4 - 3y^2 + 1$. From theorem 1, we know $y^4 - 3y^2 + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals. Thus, if $f(x)$ were reducible over the rationals, then $y^4 - 3y^2 + 1$ would also be reducible, which is a contradiction. Hence, $f(x)$ is irreducible over the rationals."

    "Given that this task requires JSON manipulation and some degree of reasoning over mathematical statements, it is not something that can be done in Lean 4 directly. As Lean 4 is a theorem prover, it is not designed for such direct manipulation of JSON data. However, a rough pseudocode of how such a task could be approached is provided below:\n\n```Pseudocode\n1. Read the JSON\n2. For each object in the 'proof' list:\n     a. If the object's 'type' is 'assertion':\n         i. If the 'claim' follows logically from the statements in 'deduced_from':\n              1. For each theorem in 'deduced_from':\n                  a. Expand the theorem into an object with fields 'name', 'statement', 'applied-to', 'assumptions-satisfied', filling in these fields based on context.\n         ii. Else:\n              1. Add a field 'error' with a description of the error.\n3. Write the JSON back out.\n```\n\nThis pseudocode can be implemented in a variety of languages with JSON manipulation capabilities, such as Python. Keep in mind that whether a 'claim' follows from the 'deduced_from' statements is a complex problem that may involve formal logic or natural language processing, and may not be possible to solve perfectly in all cases.\n\nAs the assistant, I can help you solve mathematical problems, learn how to use Lean 4, and even code in it. However, I can't execute the above pseudocode since I only understand Lean 4 code. If you have any doubts about implementing the pseudocode in a specific programming language, I recommend asking an assistant specialized in that language.",

So, the `Fundamental Theorem of Algebra` can be expanded as follows:\n```\n{\n\"name\": \"Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\",\n\"statement\": \"Every non-constant polynomial over the complex numbers has a root in its algebraic closure\",\n\"applied-to\": {\"g(x)\": \"g\", \"h(x)\": \"h\"},\n\"assumptions-satisfied\": [\"g(x) and h(x) are non-constant polynomials over Q\"]\n}\n```\nFor the second `assertion`:\nThe claim is `f(x) is irreducible over Q`. This indeed follows from the discussion in the proof leading up to this point. The claim is justified by arriving at a contradiction under the assumption that `f(x)` is not irreducible. Therefore, there is no error in this claim. However, there is no theorem listed in the `deduced_from` for this assertion. \n\nThus, the original `ProofJSON` data is accurate according to the instructions provided, and there are no errors in the claims made in the `assertion` type objects.

The theorem named 'factor-out' states that the polynomial p(x) can be obtained by factoring x-1 out of the polynomial x^5 - 1 = 0, and the theorem 'roots-of-unity' states that the roots of x^5 - 1 = 0 are the 5th roots of unity. Therefore, if 1 is factored out, the remaining roots of p(x) would be the remaining roots of unity, w, w^2, w^3, w^4.\n\nFor the second assertion:\n\nClaim: These roots are not rational\nDeduced from: 'The roots of p(x) are complex numbers'\n\nThe claim follows from the statement in 'deduced from'. If the roots of p(x) are complex numbers, these roots cannot be rational, since rational numbers are a subset of the real numbers, and complex numbers include numbers that are not real.\n\nFor the third assertion:\n\nClaim: The polynomial p(x) is irreducible over Q\nDeduced from: 'A polynomial is irreducible over a field if and only if it has no roots in that field', 'These roots are not rational'\n\nThe claim also follows from the statements in 'deduced from'. According to the first statement, a polynomial is irreducible over a field if and only if it has no roots in that field. The second statement established that the roots of p(x) are complex and therefore not rational. Therefore, the polynomial p(x) has no roots in the field of rational numbers (Q), and is therefore irreducible over Q.",

    "From the given ProofJSON, there are two assertions to check:\n\n1. In \"Theorem 1\", the claim is that \"The polynomial y^4 - 3y^2 + 1 is irreducible over the rationals.\" This claim follows from the `deduced_from` list, which includes Eisenstein's criterion. Eisenstein's criterion is a standard result in field theory which says that a polynomial is irreducible if it satisfies certain conditions related to a prime number. The conditions mentioned in the observation are those related to Eisenstein's criterion with the prime number being 3. Therefore, no error is found in this assertion.\n\n   The expanded `deduced_from` object is:\n   ```\n   {\n     \"name\": \"Eisenstein's criterion\",\n     \"statement\": \"A polynomial is irreducible over the rationals if its coefficients satisfy certain divisibility properties related to a prime number.\",\n     \"applied-to\": \"y^4 - 3y^2 + 1\",\n     \"assumptions-satisfied\": [\"The coefficients of y^4 - 3y^2 + 1 are not divisible by 3, the coefficient of the term y^2 is divisible by 3^2 but not by 3^3, and the constant term is not divisible by 3^2.\"]\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. In \"Theorem 2\", the claim is that \"The polynomial x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 is irreducible over the rationals.\" This claim is justified by asserting that if this polynomial were reducible, then another polynomial (y^4 - 3y^2 + 1) would also be reducible, which contradicts Theorem 1.
