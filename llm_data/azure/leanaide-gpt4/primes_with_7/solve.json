    "## Solution\nWe will use the concept of Dirichlet's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions, which states that for any two positive coprime integers a and d, there are infinitely many primes in the arithmetic progression a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ...\n\nIn this case, we want to find primes that end with 7, which means we are interested in primes in base 10. So we consider the arithmetic progressions 7, 17, 27, 37, ...; 17, 27, 37, 47, ...; 27, 37, 47, 57, ..., etc.\n\nEach of these progressions is of the form 10n + 7 for n = 0, 1, 2, ..., and all progressions have a common difference d=10. The numbers 7 and 10 are coprime, so according to Dirichlet's theorem, each of these progressions contains infinitely many primes.\n\nTherefore, there are infinitely many primes that end with the digit 7 in base 10.",
    "## Solution\n\nWe will use a proof by contradiction.\n\nAssume the contrary, that there are only finitely many primes which end in 7. Let them be p_1, p_2, ..., p_n.\n\nConstruct a number Q = (10*p_1*p_2*...*p_n) + 7. The last digit of Q is obviously 7, and it is greater than all the p_i. \n\nBut none of the p_i divides Q since it leaves a remainder of 7. Therefore, either Q is a prime number with a last digit 7 (contradicting our assumption that all such primes are among the p_i), or Q has a prime divisor which is greater than any of the p_i and ends in 7 (again contradicting our assumption).\n\nThus, our assumption that there are only finitely many primes ending in 7 is false. Hence, there are infinitely many primes with last digit 7.",
    "## Solution \nSuppose that there were only finitely many primes ending in 7. Let's list them as $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$. Let's define the following number:\n\n$P = 10 \\cdot (p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k) + 7$.\n\nClearly, $P$ ends in 7, and is greater than all $p_i$. \n\nIf $P$ is prime, then we found a new prime that ends in 7, which contradicts our assumption that there were only finitely many such primes.\n\nIf $P$ is not prime, then all of its prime divisors must end in 1, 3, 7 or 9 because of the property of decimal system. However, any prime divisor ending in 1 or 3 can't divide $P$ because it would leave a remainder of 7. Also, none of the primes $p_1, ..., p_k$ can divide $P$ because it would leave a remainder of 7. Therefore, $P$ must have a prime divisor that ends in 7 and is different from $p_1, ..., p_k$. Again, we found a new prime that ends in 7, which contradicts our assumption that there were only finitely many such primes.\n\nIn both cases, we reach a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that there were only finitely many primes ending in 7 is false. Hence, there are infinitely many primes with last digit 7."
