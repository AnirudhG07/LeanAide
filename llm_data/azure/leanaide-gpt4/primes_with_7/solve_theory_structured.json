However, $P$ cannot be divisible by any of the primes $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$, because it would leave a remainder of 3 when divided by any of these primes. Thus, it must be divisible by a prime number that ends with 7 and is not in our original list, contradicting our assumption that $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ were the only primes ending with 7.\n\nThus, there are infinitely many primes ending with 7.",

This number $N$ ends in 7. \n\nNow, $N$ is not divisible by any of $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$ because it leaves a remainder of 10 when divided by any of these primes.
