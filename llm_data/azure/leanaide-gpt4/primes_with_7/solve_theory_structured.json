    "## Solution\nAssume for contradiction that there are only finitely many such primes. Let these primes be $p_1,p_2,...,p_n$, and consider the number \n\n$N = 10p_1p_2...p_n - 3$. \n\nThe last digit of $N$ is 7, and $N$ is not divisible by any of the primes $p_1, p_2,...,p_n$ since it leaves a remainder of $-3$ upon division by any of them. Either $N$ is prime, in which case it is a prime ending in 7 not in our list, or it is composite. In the latter case, all of its prime divisors are primes ending in a digit other than 7, contradicting the fact that all integers ending in 7 have a prime divisor ending in 7. \n\nThis contradiction implies there must be infinitely many primes ending in 7.",
    "Suppose that there are finitely many primes which end in 7, say $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$. Let's construct a number $N = 10\\cdot(p_1 p_2\\cdots p_n) - 3$. Notice that the last digit of $N$ is 7.\n\nIf $N$ is prime, we have found a new prime that ends with 7. \n\nIf $N$ is not prime, then it has a prime divisor $p$. Notice that $p$ cannot end with 2, 5, or 0, since $N$ is odd and not divisible by 5. Therefore, $p$ must end with either 3, 7, or 9. But $p$ cannot end with 3 or 9, because this would imply that $N$ ends with 3 or 9 due to the divisibility rule for 3 and 9. So, $p$ must end with 7.\n\nHowever, notice that $p$ cannot be among $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$. Indeed, for any $i$, we have $N \\equiv -3 \\mod p_i$, but $N \\equiv 7 \\mod p_i$ (since $N$ ends with 7), which is a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, $p$ is a new prime that ends with 7, not among $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$. \n\nIn either case, we have found a new prime that ends with 7, contradicting our assumption that there are only finitely many such primes.

    "Solution:\n\nAssume for contradiction that there are only finitely many such primes, say $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$, where each $p_i$ ends in 7. We construct a number N as follows:\n\nN = $p_1p_2...p_n$ * 10 + 7\n\nNote that N is a natural number which ends in 7. We have two cases to consider:\n\n1) N is prime: In this case, N is a prime that ends in 7 and is not among the primes $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$, which contradicts our assumption.\n\n2) N is not prime: If N is not a prime, then it must have a prime divisor q that ends in 7 (since any prime greater than 5 must end in 1, 3, 7, or 9 and the last digit of N is 7). This prime q cannot be among $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$, because q divides N and leaves a remainder of 7 when divided into N, but q divides $p_1p_2...p_n$ exactly. Hence, q is a prime that ends in 7 which is not among the primes $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$, contradicting our assumption.\n\nIn either case, we get a contradiction. Hence, our assumption was wrong, and there must be infinitely many primes that end in 7."

If $N$ is prime, then $N$ becomes a prime number ending in 7 that does not belong to our initial list of primes $p_1, p_2,...,p_n$, presenting a contradiction.\n\n2. If $N$ is composite, then all of its prime divisors end in a digit other than 7.

    "Theorem: There are infinitely many primes with a last digit of 7.\n\nProof: Assume to the contrary that there are only finitely many such primes, say $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$. Construct a number $N = 10\\cdot(p_1 p_2\\cdots p_n) - 3$. The last digit of $N$ is 7.\n\nCase 1: If $N$ is prime, we have a contradiction because $N$ is a new prime with the last digit 7.\n\nCase 2: If $N$ is composite, then it has a prime divisor $p$. $N$ being odd and not divisible by 5 means $p$ cannot end with 2, 5, or 0. Therefore, $p$ must end with either 3, 7, or 9. But $p$ cannot end with 3 or 9, because this would imply $N$ ends with 3 or 9, which contradicts our construction of $N$, so $p$ must end with 7. \n\nNote also that $p$ can't be any of $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$ because for any $i$, $N \\equiv -3 \\mod p_i$, but also $N \\equiv 7 \\mod p_i$, a contradiction.

Construct a new number $N = p_1p_2...p_n \\cdot 10 + 7$; clearly, $N$ ends in 7.\n\nIf $N$ is prime, it contradicts our assumption since it is not in the list $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$.\n\nIf $N$ is composite, it must have a prime divisor that ends in 7 (as $N$ ends in 7 and any prime greater than 5 ends in 1, 3, 7, or 9). This prime, say $q$, is not among the primes $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ since $q$ divides $N$ and leaves a remainder of 7, but $q$ divides $p_1p_2...p_n$ exactly.
