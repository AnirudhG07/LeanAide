    "By contradiction, suppose that there are only finitely many primes that end with the digit 7, and label them as $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$. Construct a new number $P = (10*p_1*p_2*\\ldots*p_n) - 3$.\n\nNotice that $P$ ends with the digit 7, because $10*p_1*p_2*\\ldots*p_n$ will end with a 0 and subtracting 3 changes the last digit to 7.\n\nIf $P$ is a prime number, we found a new prime number ending with 7 which contradicts our assumption that $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ were the only such primes. \n\nIf $P$ is not a prime number, then it must be divisible by some prime number. However, $P$ cannot be divisible by any of the primes $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$, because it would leave a remainder of 3 when divided by any of these primes. Thus, it must be divisible by a prime number that ends with 7 and is not in our original list, contradicting our assumption that $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ were the only primes ending with 7.\n\nThus, there are infinitely many primes ending with 7.",

It can't be divided by any prime ending in 1, 3, or 9 as it leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 10. It can't be divided by any prime ending in 7, as it leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by any of p1, p2, ..., pn.

    "Suppose that there are finitely many primes ending in 7, say $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$. Construct a number $N$ by multiplying these primes and subtracting 10: $N = p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_k - 10$. This number $N$ ends in 7. \n\nNow, $N$ is not divisible by any of $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$ because it leaves a remainder of 10 when divided by any of these primes. Therefore, if $N$ is not prime, any prime divisor of $N$ must end in 7 and be different from $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$. \n\nSo in either case (if $N$ is prime or not), there is a prime number that ends in 7 and is not in the original list. This contradiction shows that there must be infinitely many primes ending in 7."
