    "We will use the fact that a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial has no repeated roots.\n\nGiven $A^3 = I$, it means that the polynomial $p(x) = x^3 - 1$ annihilates $A$. Now, we factorize this polynomial as $p(x) = (x - 1)(x - \\omega)(x - \\omega^2)$, where $\\omega$ is a primitive third root of unity (i.e., $\\omega = e^{2 \\pi i/3}$). \n\nNotice that $(x - \\omega)(x - \\omega^2) = x^2 + x + 1$ has no roots in common with $x - 1$, hence the roots of the minimal polynomial of $A$ cannot repeat. \n\nTherefore, $A$ is diagonalizable.",

    "Theorem: Let $A$ be a square matrix such that $A^3 = I$. Then $A$ is diagonalizable.\n\nProof: If $A^3 = I$, then $A$ is annihilated by the polynomial $p(x) = x^3 - 1$. This polynomial can be factorized as $p(x) = (x - 1)(x - \\omega)(x - \\omega^2)$, where $\\omega$ is a primitive third root of unity (i.e., $\\omega = e^{2 \\pi i/3}$). \n\nThe factors $(x - \\omega)$ and $(x - \\omega^2)$ combine to form the quadratic $x^2 + x + 1$, which has no roots in common with the factor $x - 1$. This implies that the roots of the minimal polynomial of $A$ are distinct. \n\nIt is a known result that a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial has no repeated roots. Thus, we conclude that $A$ is diagonalizable.",
    "**Theorem 1**: If $A^3 = I$ for a square matrix $A$, then the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^3 - 1 = (x-1)(x^2+x+1)$.\n\n**Proof**: Given that $A^3 = I$, we can reformulate it as $A^3 - I = 0$, or $(A-I)(A^2+A+I)=0$. This is a polynomial equation in $A$ of degree 3. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of $A$, which is the monic polynomial of least degree that annihilates $A$, must divide $x^3 - 1$.\n\n**Theorem 2**: The polynomial $x^3 - 1 = 0$ has three distinct roots in $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n**Proof**: The cubic equation $x^3 - 1 = 0$ has roots given by the cube roots of unity. These roots are 1, $e^{2\\pi i/3}$, and $e^{4\\pi i/3}$, which are three distinct numbers in $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n**Theorem 3**: If the minimal polynomial of a square matrix has no multiple roots, the matrix is diagonalizable.\n\n**Proof**: According to the Spectral Theorem, a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial factors into distinct linear factors over the field. Since by Theorem 1 the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides a polynomial with distinct roots, it must also have distinct roots. Therefore, according to this theorem, $A$ is diagonalizable.",
    "Theorem 1: \nIf a square matrix $A$ satisfies $A^3 = I$, then $A$ is diagonalizable.\n\nProof 1:\nIf $A^3 = I$, then the polynomial $p(x) = x^3 - 1$ annihilates $A$, meaning that $p(A) = 0$. The minimal polynomial of $A$ must divide $p(x)$. The roots of $p(x)$ are 1, $e^{2\\pi i/3}$, and $e^{-2\\pi i/3}$, all of which are distinct. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of $A$ must also have distinct roots. By the criterion for a matrix to be diagonalizable, which states that a square matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial is a product of distinct linear factors, we conclude that $A$ is diagonalizable."
