    "The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ (where $n$ is the size of $A$), and it splits into linear factors over the complex numbers. Therefore, it has exactly $n$ roots, counting multiplicity. \n\nBecause $A^3 = I$, the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^3 - 1$. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of $A$ is a product of distinct factors of $x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x - e^{2\\pi i/3})(x - e^{4\\pi i/3})$, where $e^{2\\pi i/3}$ and $e^{4\\pi i/3}$ are the cube roots of unity. \n\nSince each of these factors is linear, the minimal polynomial of $A$ is a product of distinct linear factors, and it follows that $A$ is diagonalizable.",
    "The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is a degree $n$ polynomial, hence it has exactly $n$ complex roots (counting multiplicity), say $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_n$. Because $A^3 = I$, the characteristic polynomial of $A$ divides $x^3 - 1 = 0$. Therefore, each $\\lambda_i$ is a root of $x^3 - 1 = 0$. \n\nThis cubic equation has three distinct roots in the complex plane: $1, e^{2\\pi i/3}, e^{4\\pi i/3}$. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of $A$ cannot have any repeated roots, as the minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial and repeated roots in the characteristic polynomial would correspond to repeated roots in the minimal polynomial.\n\nThe matrix $A$ is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial is a product of distinct linear factors.

    "The characteristic polynomial of $A^3-I=0$ is $(\\lambda^3-1)=0$. This has three distinct roots, namely $\\lambda = 1, e^{2\\pi i/3}, e^{-2\\pi i/3}$. Since $A$ is a complex matrix, it follows that the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $(\\lambda-1)(\\lambda-e^{2\\pi i/3})(\\lambda-e^{-2\\pi i/3})$, and therefore has distinct roots. By the spectral theorem, $A$ is diagonalizable."

    "**Theorem 1:** The characteristic polynomial of a square matrix splits into linear factors over the complex numbers.\n\n**Proof:** The characteristic polynomial of a square matrix is the polynomial obtained by taking the determinant of the matrix minus a variable times the identity matrix. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees that this polynomial, which has degree equal to the size of the matrix, has exactly as many roots, counting multiplicities, as its degree when considered over the complex numbers. Hence, it splits into linear factors over the complex numbers.\n\n**Theorem 2:** If $A^3 = I$, then the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^3 - 1$.\n\n**Proof:** The minimal polynomial of a matrix is the monic polynomial of least degree that the matrix satisfies. If $A^3 = I$, then $A$ satisfies the polynomial equation $x^3 - 1 = 0$, so the minimal polynomial of $A$ must divide $x^3 - 1$.\n\n**Theorem 3:** If a matrix's minimal polynomial is a product of distinct linear factors, then the matrix is diagonalizable.\n\n**Proof:** A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial has no repeated roots. If the minimal polynomial is a product of distinct linear factors, then it has no repeated roots. Therefore, the matrix is diagonalizable.\n\n**Corollary:** If $A^3 = I$ for a square matrix $A$, then $A$ is diagonalizable.\n\n**Proof:** From Theorem 2, the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^3 - 1$, so the minimal polynomial of $A$ is a product of distinct factors of $x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x - e^{2\\pi i/3})(x - e^{4\\pi i/3})$. Hence, by Theorem 3, $A$ is diagonalizable.",
    "### Theorem 1:\nLet $A$ be a square matrix. If $A^3 = I$ then $A$ is diagonalizable.\n\n### Proof:\nAssume $A$ is a square matrix with the property that $A^3 = I$. The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is a degree $n$ polynomial, therefore it has exactly $n$ complex roots (counting multiplicity), denoted as $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_n$. Due to the property $A^3 = I$, we know that the characteristic polynomial of $A$ divides $x^3 - 1 = 0$, inferring that each $\\lambda_i$ is a root of $x^3 - 1 = 0$.\n\nThe polynomial $x^3 - 1 = 0$ has three distinct roots in the complex plane: $1, e^{2\\pi i/3}, e^{4\\pi i/3}$. Because the minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial, repeated roots in the characteristic polynomial would imply repeated roots in the minimal polynomial. However, this contradicts the fact that $x^3 - 1 = 0$ has distinct roots. Hence, the minimal polynomial of $A$ contains only distinct roots.\n\nWe know that a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial is a product of distinct linear factors. Given that the minimal polynomial of $A$ has distinct roots, we conclude that $A$ is diagonalizable.",
