    "## Theorem 1\nGiven a square matrix $A$, if $A^3 = I$, then $A$ is diagonalizable.\n\n## Proof\nSince $A^3 = I$, it follows that the minimal polynomial of $A$ must divide $x^3 - 1$. However, the roots of $x^3 - 1$ are distinct. Given that the minimal polynomial of a matrix is the monic polynomial of least degree that annuls the matrix, it implies that the minimal polynomial of $A$ also has distinct roots. According to the criterion for diagonalizability, a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial can be factored into distinct linear factors. Hence, $A$ is diagonalizable. QED.",
