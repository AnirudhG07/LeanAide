    "The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ (where $n$ is the size of $A$), and it splits into linear factors over the complex numbers. Therefore, it has exactly $n$ roots, counting multiplicity. \n\nBecause $A^3 = I$, the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^3 - 1$. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of $A$ is a product of distinct factors of $x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x - e^{2\\pi i/3})(x - e^{4\\pi i/3})$, where $e^{2\\pi i/3}$ and $e^{4\\pi i/3}$ are the cube roots of unity. \n\nSince each of these factors is linear, the minimal polynomial of $A$ is a product of distinct linear factors, and it follows that $A$ is diagonalizable.",
    "The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is a degree $n$ polynomial, hence it has exactly $n$ complex roots (counting multiplicity), say $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_n$. Because $A^3 = I$, the characteristic polynomial of $A$ divides $x^3 - 1 = 0$. Therefore, each $\\lambda_i$ is a root of $x^3 - 1 = 0$. \n\nThis cubic equation has three distinct roots in the complex plane: $1, e^{2\\pi i/3}, e^{4\\pi i/3}$. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of $A$ cannot have any repeated roots, as the minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial and repeated roots in the characteristic polynomial would correspond to repeated roots in the minimal polynomial.\n\nThe matrix $A$ is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial is a product of distinct linear factors. Hence, $A$ is diagonalizable.",
    "The characteristic polynomial of $A^3-I=0$ is $(\\lambda^3-1)=0$. This has three distinct roots, namely $\\lambda = 1, e^{2\\pi i/3}, e^{-2\\pi i/3}$. Since $A$ is a complex matrix, it follows that the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $(\\lambda-1)(\\lambda-e^{2\\pi i/3})(\\lambda-e^{-2\\pi i/3})$, and therefore has distinct roots. By the spectral theorem, $A$ is diagonalizable."
