    "We will use the fact that a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial has no repeated roots.\n\nGiven $A^3 = I$, it means that the polynomial $p(x) = x^3 - 1$ annihilates $A$. Now, we factorize this polynomial as $p(x) = (x - 1)(x - \\omega)(x - \\omega^2)$, where $\\omega$ is a primitive third root of unity (i.e., $\\omega = e^{2 \\pi i/3}$). \n\nNotice that $(x - \\omega)(x - \\omega^2) = x^2 + x + 1$ has no roots in common with $x - 1$, hence the roots of the minimal polynomial of $A$ cannot repeat. \n\nTherefore, $A$ is diagonalizable.",
    "The minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^3 - 1 = (x-1)(x^2+x+1)$. Note that $x^3 - 1 = 0$ has three distinct roots in $\\mathbb{C}$. Hence, the minimal polynomial of $A$ cannot have multiple roots. Therefore, $A$ is diagonalizable.",
    "The polynomial $p(x) = x^3 - 1$ annihilates $A$, i.e., $p(A) = A^3 - I = 0$. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^3 - 1$. The roots of $x^3 - 1 = 0$ are 1, $e^{2\\pi i/3}$, and $e^{-2\\pi i/3}$, all of which are distinct. Hence, the minimal polynomial of $A$ has distinct roots.\n\nA matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial is a product of distinct linear factors. Thus, $A$ is diagonalizable."
