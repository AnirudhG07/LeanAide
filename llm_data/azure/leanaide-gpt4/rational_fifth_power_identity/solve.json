    "Let $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ be a $2 \\times 2$ matrix with rational entries. Then, $A^5 - I = 0$ implies that the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^5 - 1 = 0$. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of $A$ is among $\\{ x-1, x+1, x^2-x+1, x^2+x+1, x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1 \\}$.\n\nSince $A$ is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, its minimal polynomial has degree at most 2. Hence, the minimal polynomial of $A$ cannot be $x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1$. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of $A$ is among $\\{ x-1, x+1, x^2-x+1, x^2+x+1 \\}$.\n\nIf the minimal polynomial of $A$ is $x-1$, then $A = I$.\n\nIf the minimal polynomial of $A$ is $x+1$, then $A = -I$.\n\nIf the minimal polynomial of $A$ is $x^2 - x + 1$, then $A$ is similar to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\omega & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\omega^2 \\end{pmatrix}$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$ is a cube root of unity. The only matrices similar to this one with rational entries are scalar multiples of the identity matrix. Since $A^5 = I$, these scalar multiples must be $\\pm I$.\n\nIf the minimal polynomial of $A$ is $x^2 + x + 1$, then $A$ is similar to $\\begin{pmatrix} \\omega & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\omega^4 \\end{pmatrix}$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/5}$ is a fifth root of unity. The only matrices similar to this one with rational entries are scalar multiples of the identity matrix. Since $A^5 = I$, these scalar multiples must be $\\pm I$.\n\nHence, the only $2 \\times 2$ matrices with rational entries such that $A^5 = I$ are $\\pm I$.\n",
    "The solutions to the given problem are the $2 \\times 2$ matrices of the form\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi k}{5}) & -\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi k}{5})\\\\\n\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi k}{5}) & \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi k}{5})\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\n\nwhere $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. \n\nHowever, these are not all rational, so we need to calculate each individually to find the rational ones:\n\nConsidering values of $k$:\n\nFor $k = 0$, we have the matrix \n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nFor $k = 1$, we have \n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}) & -\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{5})\\\\\n\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{5}) & \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{5})\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\n\nwhich does not have rational entries.\n\nFor $k = 2$, we have \n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(\\frac{4\\pi}{5}) & -\\sin(\\frac{4\\pi}{5})\\\\\n\\sin(\\frac{4\\pi}{5}) & \\cos(\\frac{4\\pi}{5})\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\n\nwhich also does not have rational entries.\n\nFor $k = 3$, we have \n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(\\frac{6\\pi}{5}) & -\\sin(\\frac{6\\pi}{5})\\\\\n\\sin(\\frac{6\\pi}{5}) & \\cos(\\frac{6\\pi}{5})\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\n\nwhich again does not have rational entries.\n\nFor $k = 4$, we have \n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(\\frac{8\\pi}{5}) & -\\sin(\\frac{8\\pi}{5})\\\\\n\\sin(\\frac{8\\pi}{5}) & \\cos(\\frac{8\\pi}{5})\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\n\nwhich also does not have rational entries.\n\nSo, the only $2 \\times 2$ matrix with rational entries such that $A^5 = I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix itself.\n",
    "If $A^5 = I$ for a 2x2 matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ with rational entries, then the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^5 - 1 = 0$, which can be factored into $(x - 1)(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) = 0$. The roots of the second factor are the complex 5th roots of unity which don't equal to 1, none of which are real, let alone rational. Hence, the minimal polynomial of $A$ must be $x - 1 = 0$, i.e., $A$ equals the identity matrix $I$.\n\nTherefore, the solution is that $A = I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$."
