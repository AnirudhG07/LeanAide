    "**Theorem 1:** Let A be a 2x2 matrix with rational entries that satisfies the equation A^5 = I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix. Then A can be expressed in the form \n\n    A = [ a  b]\n        [-b  a]\n\nwhere a and b are rational numbers satisfying a^2 + b^2 = 1.\n\n**Proof:** Suppose A^5 = I for a 2x2 matrix A with rational entries. Then the eigenvalues of A are 5th roots of 1, namely 1, cos(2π/5) + isin(2π/5), cos(4π/5) + isin(4π/5), cos(6π/5) + isin(6π/5), and cos(8π/5) + isin(8π/5). Any 2x2 matrix with rational entries and 5th roots of unity as its eigenvalues can be diagonalized over the complex numbers, giving us a 2x2 matrix with entries in Q(ζ_5), the smallest subfield of the complex numbers containing the 5th roots of unity. But a 2x2 matrix with entries in Q(ζ_5) is equivalent to our original matrix A, so any such matrix can be expressed in the form given above, with a^2 + b^2 = 1 and (a,b) ∈ Q^2. This completes the proof.\n\n**Theorem 2:** The set of all 2x2 matrices with rational entries that satisfy A^5 = I is parametrized by pairs of rational numbers (a, b) that satisfy a^2 + b^2 = 1.\n\n**Proof:** From Theorem 1, we know that any 2x2 matrix A with rational entries that satisfies A^5 = I can be expressed in the form given above. The condition a^2 + b^2 = 1 is a circle of radius 1 in the plane Q^2 of rational numbers, and every point on this circle corresponds to a unique 2x2 matrix A with the property that A^5 = I. Thus, the set of all such matrices is parametrized by pairs of rational numbers (a, b) that satisfy a^2 + b^2 = 1.",
    "**Theorem 1:** All $2 \\times 2$ matrices with rational entries $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ -b & a \\end{pmatrix}$ where $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $a^2 + b^2 = 1$ satisfy the property that $A^5 = I$.\n\n**Proof:** For this type of matrix, we can express $A$ in terms of complex numbers as $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a - bi & 0 \\\\ 0 & a + bi \\end{pmatrix}$. Here $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, so $a - bi$ and $a + bi$ are conjugate complex numbers whose product is $(a - bi)(a + bi) = a^2 + b^2 = 1$. It follows that $(a - bi)^5 = (a + bi)^5 = 1$, and hence $A^5 = I$.\n\n**Theorem 2:** All $2 \\times 2$ matrices $A$ with rational entries that satisfy $A^5 = I$ are of two forms: \n\n(i) $A = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos \\frac{2\\pi k}{5} & -\\sin \\frac{2\\pi k}{5} \\\\ \\sin \\frac{2\\pi k}{5} & \\cos \\frac{2\\pi k}{5} \\end{pmatrix}$, for $0 \\leq k \\leq 4$, and \n\n(ii) $A = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos \\frac{2\\pi k}{5} & \\sin \\frac{2\\pi k}{5} \\\\ -\\sin \\frac{2\\pi k}{5} & \\cos \\frac{2\\pi k}{5} \\end{pmatrix}$, for $0 \\leq k \\leq 4$.\n\n**Proof:** The eigenvalues of such a matrix $A$ are roots of a quadratic polynomial with rational coefficients, hence they are either two distinct real numbers, a double real number, or a pair of conjugate complex numbers. In any case, their fifth powers must be $1$, thus they must be fifth roots of unity. These are $1, e^{2\\pi i/5}, e^{4\\pi i/5}, e^{6\\pi i/5}$, and $e^{8\\pi i/5}$.  Only $1$ and $e^{4\\pi i/5}$ are real, leading to matrices of the first form (with $k=0$ and $k=2$). The remaining ones lead to matrices of the second form. The cosine and sine of multiples of $\\frac{2\\pi}{5}$ are rational, completing the proof.",
    "**Theorem 1:** Let A be a 2x2 matrix with rational entries. If A^5 = I, where I is the 2x2 identity matrix, then A is either the 2x2 identity matrix or its negative.\n\n**Proof of Theorem 1:** \n\nA 2x2 matrix A satisfying A^5 = I can be written in the form \n\\[\nA =\n\\begin{{bmatrix}}\n\\cos(2 \\pi k/5) & -\\sin(2 \\pi k/5) \\\\\n\\sin(2 \\pi k/5) & \\cos(2 \\pi k/5) \\\\\n\\end{{bmatrix}}\n\\]\nfor some integer k such that -5 ≤ k ≤ 5. \n\nThis form arises from the fact that A^5 = I signifies that A has order 5, which implies that any eigenvalue λ of A satisfies λ^5 = 1. Therefore, λ is a 5th root of unity, and hence is of the form λ = exp(2πik/5) for some integer -5 ≤ k ≤ 5. This gives the stated form for A.\n\nHowever, since A has rational entries, cos(2πk/5) and sin(2πk/5) must both be rational. These values are rational if and only if k = 0, ±5, as these are the only values for which cos(2πk/5) and sin(2πk/5) are rational numbers. \n\nSubstituting these values gives the matrices A = \n\\[\n\\begin{{bmatrix}}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{{bmatrix}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \n\\begin{{bmatrix}}\n-1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1 \\\\\n\\end{{bmatrix}}\n\\]\nwhich are the 2x2 identity matrix and its negative, respectively. ∎"
