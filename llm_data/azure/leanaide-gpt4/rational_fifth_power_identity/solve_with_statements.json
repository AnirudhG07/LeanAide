    "Let $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ be a $2 \\times 2$ matrix with rational entries. Then, $A^5 - I = 0$ implies that the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^5 - 1 = 0$.

    "**Theorem 1:** The only $2 \\times 2$ matrices with rational entries such that $A^5 = I$ are $\\pm I$.\n\n**Proof of Theorem 1:**\nLet $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ be a $2 \\times 2$ matrix with rational entries. The condition $A^5 = I$ implies that the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides the polynomial $x^5 - 1$. The possible divisors of $x^5 - 1$ are: $x-1$, $x+1$, $x^2-x+1$, $x^2+x+1$, and $x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1$.\n\nGiven that $A$ is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, the degree of its minimal polynomial is $2$ at most. Hence, we can discard the polynomial $x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1$. \n\nIf the minimal polynomial is $x-1$ or $x+1$, then $A$ is the identity matrix $I$ or its negative $-I$.\n\nIf the minimal polynomial is $x^2 - x + 1$, it means $A$ is similar to a matrix that is diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{R}$ with eigenvalues that are roots of the polynomial $x^2 - x + 1$. These roots are complex cube roots of unity. The only matrices similar to a diagonal matrix with complex eigenvalues that have rational entries are scalar multiples of identity matrices, and the scalar multiples satisfying $A^5 = I$ are $\\pm I$.\n\nSimilarly, if the minimal polynomial is $x^2 + x + 1$, $A$ is similar to a matrix that is diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{R}$ with eigenvalues that are roots of the polynomial $x^2 + x + 1$. These roots are complex fifth roots of unity. Again, the only matrices similar to a diagonal matrix with complex eigenvalues that have rational entries are scalar multiples of identity matrices, and the scalar multiples satisfying $A^5 = I$ are $\\pm I$.\n\nHence, the only $2 \\times 2$ matrices with rational entries such that $A^5 = I$ are $\\pm I$.",
    "Theorem: The only $2 \\times 2$ matrix with rational entries that satisfies $A^5 = I$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix, is the identity matrix itself.\n\nProof: Consider the general $2 \\times 2$ matrix representation for the solution of $A^5 = I$,\n\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(\\frac{2\\pi k}{5}) & -\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi k}{5})\\\\\n\\sin(\\frac{2\\pi k}{5}) & \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi k}{5})\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\n\nwhere $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. \n\nThe cosine and sine functions do not produce rational values for these inputs except for $k = 0$. Therefore, the only $2 \\times 2$ matrix with rational entries that satisfies $A^5 = I$ is the case where $k = 0$, yielding the identity matrix\n\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nThis completes the proof.",
    "**Theorem 1**: The only 2x2 matrix with rational entries, denoted as $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$, such that $A^5 = I$ is the 2x2 identity matrix $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Proof**: Suppose that $A^5 = I$ for some 2x2 matrix $A$. Then the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides the polynomial $x^5 - 1$. This polynomial factors as $(x - 1)(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)$. The roots of the second factor are the non-real complex 5th roots of unity. Therefore, since $A$ has rational entries, its minimal polynomial cannot have these roots, and so it must be $x - 1$. This implies that $A = I$. Thus, the 2x2 identity matrix is the only such $A$. \n\n**Theorem 2**: The polynomial $x^5 - 1$ factors into $(x - 1)(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)$ and the roots of the second factor are the non-real complex 5th roots of unity.\n\n**Proof**: The polynomial $x^5 - 1$ equals to zero when $x$ is a 5th root of unity. These roots are solutions to the equation $x^5 = 1$, which include $x = 1$ and the four complex 5th roots of unity. When $x = 1$ is removed, the remaining roots are precisely the roots of the second factor, $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$. These roots are non-real complex numbers."
