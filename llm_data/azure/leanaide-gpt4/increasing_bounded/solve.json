    "This statement is true. Suppose $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function with $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n\nSince $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the function $f$ is strictly increasing. \n\nNow, pick any $M > 0$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, there exists some $x_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_1) > M$. Similarly, for any $M < 0$, there exists some $x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_2) < M$. \n\nHence, the function $f$ is unbounded.",
    "The statement is true. \n\nWe first note that $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ implies that $f$ is strictly increasing. \n\nNow, we show that $f$ is unbounded. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $f$ is bounded. Then, there exists an $M > 0$ such that $|f(x)| \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n\nChoose arbitrary $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, we have $f(x) < f(x_0) + M$ for all $x < x_0$ and $f(x) > f(x_0) - M$ for all $x > x_0$. However, this contradicts the assumption that $f$ is bounded. \n\nTherefore, $f$ must be unbounded.",
    "The claim is true. \n\nThe function $f$ is strictly increasing because $f'(x)>0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, by the Mean Value Theorem. This means that for any $M > 0$, there exists $x_M \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_M) > M$. Hence, $f$ is unbounded above. \n\nSimilarly, since $f$ is strictly increasing, for any $M < 0$, there exists $x_M \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_M) < M$. Hence, $f$ is unbounded below. \n\nTherefore, $f$ is unbounded."
