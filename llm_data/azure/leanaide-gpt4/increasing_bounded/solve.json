    "The statement is true. \n\nSince $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, this means $f$ is strictly increasing. \n\nNow, suppose to the contrary that $f$ is bounded. Then there exist real numbers $M$ and $m$ such that $m \\leq f(x) \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n\nSince $f$ is continuous and $[m, M]$ is a closed interval, the image of $f$ is a closed interval $[m, M]$ by the Extreme Value Theorem, hence it achieves its maximum and minimum.\n\nBut as $f$ is strictly increasing, it can either achieve its maximum or its minimum, but not both, which contradicts the Extreme Value Theorem. \n\nHence, the assumption that $f$ is bounded is false, and $f$ is unbounded.",
    "The statement is true. \n\nTo see this, consider any point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the function $f$ is strictly increasing. \n\nThus, for any $x > x_0$, we have $f(x) > f(x_0)$; i.e., $f$ is unbounded above. \n\nSimilarly, for any $x < x_0$, we have $f(x) < f(x_0)$; i.e., $f$ is unbounded below. \n\nTherefore, the function $f$ is unbounded.",
    "The statement is true. \n\nIf $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then by the Mean Value Theorem, for any $a < b$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, there exists some $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} > 0$. This implies $f(b) > f(a)$. \n\nThus $f$ is strictly increasing and therefore $f(x)$ is unbounded as $x \\rightarrow \\infty$ or $x \\rightarrow -\\infty$. Specifically, $f(x)$ goes to $-\\infty$ as $x$ goes to $-\\infty$ and $f(x)$ goes to $\\infty$ as $x$ goes to $\\infty$."
