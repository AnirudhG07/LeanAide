    "This statement is true. Suppose $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function with $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n\nSince $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the function $f$ is strictly increasing. \n\nNow, pick any $M > 0$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, there exists some $x_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_1) > M$. Similarly, for any $M < 0$, there exists some $x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_2) < M$. \n\nHence, the function $f$ is unbounded.",
    "The statement is true. \n\nWe first note that $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ implies that $f$ is strictly increasing. \n\nNow, we show that $f$ is unbounded. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $f$ is bounded. Then, there exists an $M > 0$ such that $|f(x)| \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n\nChoose arbitrary $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

    "The claim is true. \n\nThe function $f$ is strictly increasing because $f'(x)>0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, by the Mean Value Theorem.

Hence, $f$ is unbounded above. \n\nSimilarly, since $f$ is strictly increasing, for any $M < 0$, there exists $x_M \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_M) < M$.

    "Theorem: Given a continuous function $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ where $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is strictly increasing. \n\nProof: Consider any $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $x_1 < x_2$. The Mean Value Theorem guarantees the existence of a point $c$ in the open interval $(x_1, x_2)$ satisfying $f'(c) = (f(x_2) - f(x_1)) / (x_2 - x_1)$. Since $f'(c) > 0$, we conclude $f(x_2) > f(x_1)$. Thus, the function $f$ is strictly increasing. \n\nTheorem: Given a strictly increasing continuous function $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is unbounded.\n\nProof: For $f$ to be bounded, there would exist $M > 0$ such that $|f(x)| \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Given that $f$ is strictly increasing, for each $M > 0$, we can always find $x_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_1) > M$. Similarly, for each $M < 0$, we can always find $x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_2) < M$. This contradicts the definition of boundedness, thus $f$ must be unbounded.",

Then by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists $c \\in (x, y)$ such that $f'(c) = \\frac{f(y) - f(x)}{y - x}$. Given that $f'(c) > 0$, it must be that $f(y) - f(x) > 0$, i.e., $f(y) > f(x)$.

    "To assess whether each claim follows from the results in `deduced_from` and to provide the required expansion, we have to examine each `assertion` in the proofs of both `theorem_1` and `theorem_2`. Let's analyze each assertion:\n\nFor `theorem_1`:\n\nThe claim \"$f(x_2) > f(x_1)$\" is deduced from \"Given $f'(c) > 0$\". This indeed follows from the given condition because $f'(c) > 0$ indicates a strictly increasing function, and thus for $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_2) > f(x_1)$. Therefore, there's no `error` field required. The `deduced_from` field could be expanded to:\n\n```\n\"deduced-from\": [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Definition of strictly increasing function\",\n    \"statement\": \"A function f(x) is strictly increasing if and only if f'(x) > 0 for all x\",\n    \"applied-to\": {\n      \"f\": \"f\",\n      \"x\": \"c\"\n    },\n    \"assumptions-satisfied\": [\"f is differentiable\"]\n  }\n]\n```\n\nNow, for `theorem_2`:\n\nThe first assertion has a claim \"$f(x_1) > M$\" that is justified by \"Given by assumption\". Since this is a hypothetical situation, it's hard to determine whether the claim follows from the given assumption or not. As such, an `error` field isn't added.\n\nThe second assertion has a claim \"$f(x_2) < M$\", which is also justified by \"Given by assumption\". Similar to the first assertion, we can't add an `error` field due to lack of specific rules or theorems that the claim is deduced from.\n\nThe third assertion claims that \"$f$ is unbounded\". The justification is \"As there exists no such M that satisfies the boundedness condition for $f$\", which is a direct contradiction to the assumption that $|f(x)| \\\\\\\\leq M$. Hence, the claim does follow from the justification, but it should be noted that the previous assertions are based on assumptions, and are not deduced from any specific mathematical rule or theorem. Therefore, for the first two assertions, it's challenging to provide an expansion similar to the sample provided.\n\nThe `deduced_from` field for the third assertion could be expanded like this:\n\n```\n\"deduced-from\": [\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Definition of unbounded function\",\n    \"statement\": \"A function f(x) is unbounded if and only if for every real number M, there exists x such that |f(x)| > M\",\n    \"applied-to\": {\n      \"f\": \"f\",\n      \"M\": \"M\"\n    },\n    \"assumptions-satisfied\": [\"f is a real-valued function\"]\n  }\n]\n```",

    "I would like to clarify the task's requirement before proceeding. The task is to add an `error` field to any `assertion` that does not logically follow from the results in its `deduced_from` field. On the other hand, for those that do logically follow, we will expand each theorem in the `deduced_from` field with additional details such as `name`, `statement`, `applied-to`, and `assumptions-satisfied`.\n\nFor the provided JSON in this case, let's go through each assertion:\n\n1) Theorem 1 assertion:\n- Claim: `\"f is strictly increasing\"`\n- Deduced_from: `[\"Mean Value Theorem\"]`\n\nThe 'Mean Value Theorem' does indeed imply that if a function `f` is differentiable and `f'(x) > 0 for all x in R`, then `f` is strictly increasing. Hence, the claim follows logically from the `deduced_from`.

However, the claim can be logically derived from the assumption that `f` is a strictly increasing function in R. Therefore, there is no need to add an `error` field here.\n\nPlease clarify if you want the `deduced_from` field to only contain previously stated theorems or if it can also include basic logical deductions from the assumptions.",
