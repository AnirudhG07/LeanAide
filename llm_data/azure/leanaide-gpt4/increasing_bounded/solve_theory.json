    "The statement is true. \n\nSince $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, this means $f$ is strictly increasing. \n\nNow, suppose to the contrary that $f$ is bounded. Then there exist real numbers $M$ and $m$ such that $m \\leq f(x) \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n\nSince $f$ is continuous and $[m, M]$ is a closed interval, the image of $f$ is a closed interval $[m, M]$ by the Extreme Value Theorem, hence it achieves its maximum and minimum.\n\nBut as $f$ is strictly increasing, it can either achieve its maximum or its minimum, but not both, which contradicts the Extreme Value Theorem. \n\nHence, the assumption that $f$ is bounded is false, and $f$ is unbounded.",
    "The statement is true. \n\nTo see this, consider any point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the function $f$ is strictly increasing. \n\nThus, for any $x > x_0$, we have $f(x) > f(x_0)$; i.e., $f$ is unbounded above. \n\nSimilarly, for any $x < x_0$, we have $f(x) < f(x_0)$; i.e., $f$ is unbounded below. \n\nTherefore, the function $f$ is unbounded.",
    "The statement is true. \n\nIf $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then by the Mean Value Theorem, for any $a < b$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, there exists some $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} > 0$. This implies $f(b) > f(a)$. \n\nThus $f$ is strictly increasing and therefore $f(x)$ is unbounded as $x \\rightarrow \\infty$ or $x \\rightarrow -\\infty$. Specifically, $f(x)$ goes to $-\\infty$ as $x$ goes to $-\\infty$ and $f(x)$ goes to $\\infty$ as $x$ goes to $\\infty$."

    "**Theorem 1**: A continuous and strictly increasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is unbounded.\n\n**Proof**: Assume for contradiction that $f$ is bounded. Then there exist real numbers $M$ and $m$ such that $m \\leq f(x) \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n\nDue to continuity of $f$, and $[m, M]$ being a closed interval, the image of $f$ is a closed interval $[m, M]$. Therefore, $f$ achieves its maximum and minimum by the Extreme Value Theorem.\n\nHowever, owning to $f$ being strictly increasing, it can either achieve its maximum or its minimum, but not both. This contradicts the Extreme Value Theorem, thus implying that the assumption that $f$ is bounded is incorrect. Therefore, $f$ is unbounded.\n\n**Theorem 2**: If $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous and $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is unbounded.\n\n**Proof**: From the hypothesis, $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This implies that $f$ is strictly increasing. By Theorem 1, $f$ is unbounded. Therefore, if $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ must be unbounded.",
    "**Theorem 1**: Suppose $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function such that $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is strictly increasing.\n\n**Proof of Theorem 1**: Choose any two points $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $x_1 < x_2$. Then by the mean value theorem, there exists a point $c$ in $(x_1, x_2)$ such that $f'(c) = \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}$. Since $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $f'(c) > 0$. Therefore, $f(x_2) - f(x_1) > 0$, or equivalently $f(x_2) > f(x_1)$. This holds for any $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $x_1 < x_2$, hence $f$ is strictly increasing.\n\n**Theorem 2**: If $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is strictly increasing, then $f$ is unbounded.\n\n**Proof of Theorem 2**: Let $x_0$ be any point in $\\mathbb{R}$. For any number $M > f(x_0)$, since $f$ is strictly increasing, there exists $x_1 > x_0$ such that $f(x_1) > M$. This shows that $f$ is unbounded above. Similarly, for any number $M < f(x_0)$, there exists $x_2 < x_0$ such that $f(x_2) < M$. This shows that $f$ is unbounded below. Therefore, $f$ is unbounded.",

By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a $c \\in (a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$. Given that $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, it follows that $f'(c) > 0$.

Hence, $f(x)$ is unbounded as $x \\rightarrow \\infty$. Similarly, for any real number $N$, there exists $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) < N$. Hence, $f(x)$ is also unbounded as $x \\rightarrow -\\infty$. Thus, $f$ is unbounded."
