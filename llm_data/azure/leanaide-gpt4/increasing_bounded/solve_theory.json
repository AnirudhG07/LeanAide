    "The statement is true. Since $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the function $f$ is strictly increasing. Therefore, for any given $M \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there exists $x_M \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) > M$ for all $x > x_M$, meaning $f$ is unbounded.",
    "The statement is true. Let's prove it:\n\nIf $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is strictly increasing. This is because the derivative of a function gives the rate of change of the function, and a positive rate of change implies an increasing function.\n\nNow, since $f$ is strictly increasing, for any $M \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there exists an $x_M \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) > M$ for all $x > x_M$. This is because, as $x$ increases, the value of $f(x)$ also increases without bound due to its strictly increasing nature.\n\nSimilarly, for any $M \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there exists an $x'_M \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) < -M$ for all $x < x'_M$.\n\nHence, $f$ is unbounded.",

    "Theorem 1: Suppose $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function such that $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is strictly increasing.\n\nProof 1: Since $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the rate of change of $f$ is positive for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $f$ is strictly increasing.\n\nTheorem 2: If $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is strictly increasing, then for any $M \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there exists an $x_M \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) > M$ for all $x > x_M$.\n\nProof 2: By the strictly increasing nature of $f$, as $x$ increases, the value of $f(x)$ also increases without bound. Hence, for any $M \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there must exist an $x_M$ such that $f(x) > M$ for all $x > x_M$.\n\nTheorem 3: If $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is strictly increasing, then for any $M \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there exists an $x'_M \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) < -M$ for all $x < x'_M$.\n\nProof 3: Similarly to Proof 2, the strictly increasing nature of $f$ implies that for any $M \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there must exist an $x'_M$ such that $f(x) < -M$ for all $x < x'_M$.\n\nCorollary: Suppose $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function such that $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is unbounded.\n\nProof of Corollary: By Theorem 1, $f$ is strictly increasing. By Theorem 2 and Theorem 3, for any $M \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there exists an $x_M$ such that $f(x) > M$ for all $x > x_M$ and an $x'_M$ such that $f(x) < -M$ for all $x < x'_M$.
