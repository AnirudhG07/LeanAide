    "This statement is true. Suppose $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function with $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n\nSince $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the function $f$ is strictly increasing. \n\nNow, pick any $M > 0$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, there exists some $x_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_1) > M$. Similarly, for any $M < 0$, there exists some $x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_2) < M$. \n\nHence, the function $f$ is unbounded.",
    "The statement is true. \n\nWe first note that $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ implies that $f$ is strictly increasing. \n\nNow, we show that $f$ is unbounded. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $f$ is bounded. Then, there exists an $M > 0$ such that $|f(x)| \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. \n\nChoose arbitrary $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, we have $f(x) < f(x_0) + M$ for all $x < x_0$ and $f(x) > f(x_0) - M$ for all $x > x_0$. However, this contradicts the assumption that $f$ is bounded. \n\nTherefore, $f$ must be unbounded.",
    "The claim is true. \n\nThe function $f$ is strictly increasing because $f'(x)>0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, by the Mean Value Theorem. This means that for any $M > 0$, there exists $x_M \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_M) > M$. Hence, $f$ is unbounded above. \n\nSimilarly, since $f$ is strictly increasing, for any $M < 0$, there exists $x_M \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_M) < M$. Hence, $f$ is unbounded below. \n\nTherefore, $f$ is unbounded."

    "Theorem: Given a continuous function $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ where $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is strictly increasing. \n\nProof: Consider any $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $x_1 < x_2$. The Mean Value Theorem guarantees the existence of a point $c$ in the open interval $(x_1, x_2)$ satisfying $f'(c) = (f(x_2) - f(x_1)) / (x_2 - x_1)$. Since $f'(c) > 0$, we conclude $f(x_2) > f(x_1)$. Thus, the function $f$ is strictly increasing. \n\nTheorem: Given a strictly increasing continuous function $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is unbounded.\n\nProof: For $f$ to be bounded, there would exist $M > 0$ such that $|f(x)| \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Given that $f$ is strictly increasing, for each $M > 0$, we can always find $x_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_1) > M$. Similarly, for each $M < 0$, we can always find $x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_2) < M$. This contradicts the definition of boundedness, thus $f$ must be unbounded.",
    "**Theorem 1:**\nSuppose $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function such that $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is strictly increasing.\n\n**Proof of Theorem 1:**\nConsider arbitrary $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $x < y$. Then by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists $c \\in (x, y)$ such that $f'(c) = \\frac{f(y) - f(x)}{y - x}$. Given that $f'(c) > 0$, it must be that $f(y) - f(x) > 0$, i.e., $f(y) > f(x)$. Thus, $f$ is strictly increasing.\n\n**Theorem 2:**\nSuppose $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous, strictly increasing function. Then $f$ is unbounded.\n\n**Proof of Theorem 2:**\nAssume for contradiction that $f$ is bounded. Then, there exists an $M > 0$ such that $|f(x)| \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nChoose arbitrary $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, we have $f(x) < f(x_0) + M$ for all $x < x_0$ and $f(x) > f(x_0) - M$ for all $x > x_0$.
