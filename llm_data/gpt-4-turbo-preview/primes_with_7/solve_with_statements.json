    "Assume for contradiction that there are only finitely many primes with last digit 7, and let them be \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\). Consider the number \\(N = 10\\prod_{i=1}^{n}p_i + 7\\).

    "## Theorem\nThere are infinitely many primes with last digit 7.\n\n### Proof\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that the set of all primes with last digit 7 is finite. Let this set be denoted by \\(S = \\{p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\}\\), where \\(n\\) is a positive integer. Consider the number \\(N = 10\\prod_{i=1}^{n}p_i + 7\\). By construction, \\(N\\) ends in 7 and is strictly greater than any \\(p_i\\) in \\(S\\).\n\nFirst, note that \\(N\\) is not divisible by any prime in \\(S\\) since if a prime \\(p_i\\) in \\(S\\) divided \\(N\\), then \\(N\\) would be congruent to 7 modulo \\(p_i\\), which contradicts the construction of \\(N\\).\n\nIf \\(N\\) itself is prime, then it is a prime with last digit 7 not included in our original set \\(S\\), contradicting our assumption that \\(S\\) contains all such primes.\n\nIf \\(N\\) is composite, it must have a prime factor not in \\(S\\). This prime factor cannot end in 1, 3, or 9 without forcing \\(N\\) to end in a digit other than 7, due to the multiplicative properties of the decimal system. Therefore, any new prime factor of \\(N\\) must end in 7, providing a contradiction to our original assumption that all primes ending in 7 are contained in \\(S\\).\n\nThus, under both possible conditions for \\(N\\), we arrive at a contradiction, implying our original assumption that there are only finitely many primes with last digit 7 is false. Therefore, there must be infinitely many primes with last digit 7.",
    "## Theorem\nThere are infinitely many primes with the last digit 7.\n\n### Proof\nConsider the arithmetic progression defined by \\(10k + 7\\) for \\(k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). We aim to show that this progression contains infinitely many primes. \n\n**Step 1**: Observe that if there were only finitely many such primes, say \\(p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\\), we can construct a particular number that leads to a contradiction.\n\n**Step 2**: Construct the number \\(N = 10(p_1p_2...p_n) - 3\\). By construction, \\(N\\) ends in 7, fitting the form of numbers we are considering.\n\n**Step 3**: We show that \\(N\\) cannot be divisible by any of the primes \\(p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\\). For any \\(p_i\\), \\(N + 3 = 10(p_1p_2...p_n)\\) is divisible by \\(p_i\\), but \\(N\\) leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by \\(p_i\\), not zero.\n\n**Step 4**: Since \\(N\\) is not divisible by any \\(p_i\\), and since it is greater than 1 and ends in 7, it must have a prime factor that is not in our initial list and similarly ends in 7. This contradicts our assumption of having listed all such primes.\n\n**Conclusion**: By contradiction, there must be infinitely many primes that end in the digit 7.",
    "**Theorem:** There are infinitely many primes with the last digit 7.\n\n**Proof:** Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a finite number of primes whose last digit is 7, denoted as \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\). Construct the number \\(N = 10\\cdot(p_1p_2 \\cdots p_n) - 3\\). It is evident that \\(N\\) ends in 7. Moreover, \\(N\\) cannot be divisible by any of the primes \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\). To see this, note that if \\(N\\) were divisible by any \\(p_i\\) (for some \\(i\\) between 1 and \\(n\\)), then \\(10\\cdot(p_1p_2 \\cdots p_n)\\) would yield a remainder of 3 upon division by \\(p_i\\), which is a contradiction since \\(p_i\\) divides \\(10\\cdot(p_1p_2 \\cdots p_n)\\) perfectly. Therefore, \\(N\\) is either prime itself, contradicting the assumption that all primes ending in 7 are among \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\), or it has a prime divisor not in the list \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\) that necessarily ends in 7, contradicting the assumption of finiteness. Thus, our initial assumption must be false, implying the infinitude of primes with the last digit 7."
