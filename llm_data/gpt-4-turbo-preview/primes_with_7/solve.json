    "Assume for contradiction that there are only finitely many primes with last digit 7, and let them be \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\). Consider the number \\(N = 10\\prod_{i=1}^{n}p_i + 7\\). Clearly, \\(N\\) ends in 7 and is greater than each \\(p_i\\).\n\nSince \\(N\\) is not divisible by any prime ending in 7 (by construction), if \\(N\\) is prime, we have found a prime ending in 7 not in our list, a contradiction. If \\(N\\) is not prime, it must have a prime factor not in our list, since otherwise, \\(N\\) would be divisible by 10, which it is not (its last digit is 7). Any prime factor of \\(N\\) not among \\(p_1, \\ldots, p_n\\) that divides \\(N\\) cannot end in 1, 3, or 9, for such a factor would make \\(N\\) end in a digit other than 7, given the form of \\(N\\). Thus, this prime factor must end in 7, providing the contradiction. \n\nHence, there must be infinitely many primes with last digit 7.",
    "Consider the numbers of the form \\(10k + 7\\) where \\(k\\) is a natural number. Clearly, some of these numbers must be prime, or else they would all have prime factors other than themselves, implying that all primes divide some number of the form \\(10m\\), which is not possible since there are primes that do not divide 10 directly.\n\nAssume for contradiction that there are only finitely many primes of the form \\(10k + 7\\), say \\(p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\\). Consider the number \\(N = 10(p_1p_2...p_n) - 3\\). Note that \\(N\\) ends in a 7 because \\(10 \\times \\text{anything} - 3\\) will always end in 7. \n\nFor each \\(p_i\\) in our finite list, \\(N\\) is obviously not divisible by \\(p_i\\) since \\(N + 3 = 10(p_1p_2...p_n)\\) is divisible by \\(p_i\\), but \\(N\\) would leave a remainder of 3 upon division by \\(p_i\\), not 0. Hence, \\(N\\) has a prime factor that is not in our list, which contradicts our assumption that we have listed all primes of the form \\(10k + 7\\).\n\nTherefore, there must be infinitely many primes with the last digit 7.",
    "Suppose there are only finitely many primes with last digit 7, say \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\). Consider the number \\(N = 10\\cdot(p_1p_2 \\cdots p_n) - 3\\). Clearly, \\(N\\) ends in 7. Also, \\(N\\) is not divisible by any of \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\), for if it were, \\(10\\cdot(p_1p_2 \\cdots p_n)\\) would leave a remainder of 3 upon division by any of these primes, which is impossible. Hence, either \\(N\\) itself is a prime number ending in 7, which is not in the list \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\), or it has a prime divisor that ends in 7 and is not among \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\). In either case, we have a contradiction. Therefore, there must be infinitely many primes with last digit 7."
