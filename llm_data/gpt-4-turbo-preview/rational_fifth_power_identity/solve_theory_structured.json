    "### Theorem\nLet $A$ be a $2 \\times 2$ matrix with rational entries. Then $A^5 = I$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix, if and only if $A$ is one of the following matrices:\n\\[A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad A = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]\n\n### Proof\nLet $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ be a $2 \\times 2$ matrix with rational entries such that $A^5 = I$.\n\n1. **Characteristic Polynomial and Eigenvalues**: The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is given by $\\chi_A(\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 - (a + d)\\lambda + (ad - bc) = 0$. Since $A^5 = I$, the eigenvalues of $A$ must satisfy $\\lambda^5 = 1$. The only rational solutions to $\\lambda^5 = 1$ are $\\lambda = 1$ and $\\lambda = -1$.\n\n2. **Determining $a, b, c, d$ for $\\lambda = 1$**: If $\\lambda = 1$, then for $A$ to have $\\lambda = 1$ as an eigenvalue, we must have $a + d = 2$ and $ad - bc = 1$. The simplest solution satisfying these conditions with rational entries is when $A$ is the identity matrix, $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n3. **Determining $a, b, c, d$ for $\\lambda = -1$**: If $\\lambda = -1$, then for $A$ to have $\\lambda = -1$ as an eigenvalue, we must have $a + d = -2$ and $ad - bc = 1$. The simplest solution satisfying these conditions with rational entries is when $A = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n4. **Exclusion of Other Matrices**: Suppose there exists another matrix $A$ with rational entries such that $A^5 = I$. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, the characteristic polynomial of $A$ can have at most two distinct roots, which must be among the fifth roots of unity. However, since the entries of $A$ are rational, and the only rational fifth roots of unity are $\\lambda = 1$ and $\\lambda = -1$, the only possible eigenvalues of $A$ are $\\pm 1$. Any other matrix with rational entries that satisfies $A^5 = I$ must also have these eigenvalues. The specific forms of $A$ are directly tied to these eigenvalues and the requirement that $A$ has rational entries. Hence, no other matrices with rational entries satisfy $A^5 = I$ except for the two matrices listed.\n\nTherefore, the only $2 \\times 2$ matrices with rational entries such that $A^5 = I$ are $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.",
    "### Theorem 1\nA $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A$ with rational entries satisfies $A^5 = I$ if and only if $A = I$ or $A = -I$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n\n### Proof\nLet $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ be a $2 \\times 2$ matrix with rational entries. Since $A^5 = I$, the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $A$ must satisfy $\\lambda^5 = 1$. The only rational solutions to this equation are $\\lambda = 1$ and $\\lambda = -1$.\n\nIf $\\lambda = 1$, the eigenvalues of $A$ are both 1, and since $A$ has rational entries and satisfies a polynomial equation with leading coefficient $1$ ($A^5 - I = 0$), by the Rational Root Theorem, the minimal polynomial dividing $x^5 - 1$ for $A$ must be $x - 1$. Hence, $A - I = 0$, implying $A = I$.\n\nIf $\\lambda = -1$, the eigenvalues of $A$ are both -1, and by a similar argument, the minimal polynomial for $A$ must be $x + 1$. Thus, $A + I = 0$, implying $A = -I$.\n\nTo see that no other matrices satisfy this condition, note that any other rational eigenvalue solution of $\\lambda^5 = 1$ would lead to a contradiction, as the only rational roots are $\\lambda = 1$ or $\\lambda = -1$. Further, any other structure for $A$ would not allow it to satisfy $A^5 = I$ due to the constraints on its eigenvalues and the requirement for rational entries.\n\nHence, the only $2 \\times 2$ matrices with rational entries that satisfy $A^5 = I$ are $A = I$ and $A = -I$.",
    "### Theorem\nThe only $2 \\times 2$ matrices with rational entries that satisfy $A^5 = I$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix, are\n\\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\} \\]\n\n### Proof\nLet $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ be a $2 \\times 2$ matrix with rational entries satisfying $A^5 = I$. By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, $A$ satisfies its own characteristic equation. The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is given by $p(\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 - (a+d)\\lambda + (ad-bc) = 0$. Since $A^5 = I$, the eigenvalues of $A$ must be the fifth roots of unity: $\\lambda = 1, -1, \\zeta, \\zeta^2, \\zeta^3, \\zeta^4$, where $\\zeta$ is a primitive fifth root of unity.\n\nHowever, since $A$ has rational entries, its eigenvalues, which solve a polynomial with rational coefficients, must either be rational or occur in conjugate pairs. The roots of unity $\\zeta, \\zeta^2, \\zeta^3, \\zeta^4$ are not rational, and they do not form pairs of rational conjugates. Thus, the only possible eigenvalues for $A$ are $1$ and $-1$.\n\nFor $A$ to have $1$ as an eigenvalue of multiplicity two, $A$ must be $I$. For $A$ to have $-1$ as an eigenvalue of multiplicity two, $A$ must be $-I$.\n\nFor $A$ to have eigenvalues $1$ and $-1$, it must be similar to a Jordan block with eigenvalue $-1$ or $1$. Since $\\zeta$ and its powers are not applicable, we are left with matrices that cyclically permute the basis vectors or negate them. Inspection and algebraic manipulation give us the matrices \n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\nas the only other solutions besides the identity matrix.\n\nTherefore, the solution set is complete, as given in the theorem statement."
