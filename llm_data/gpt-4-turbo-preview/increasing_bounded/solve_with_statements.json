    "### Theorem\nLet $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function such that $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is unbounded.\n\n### Proof\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that $f$ is bounded. Then, there exist real numbers $M$ and $m$ such that for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $m \\leq f(x) \\leq M$. Since $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$ and differentiable with $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, it follows that $f$ is strictly increasing on $\\mathbb{R}$. \n\nConsider any $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, for any $x > x_0$, we have $f(x) > f(x_0)$. By choosing $x$ sufficiently large, we can make $f(x)$ arbitrarily large, contradicting the assumption that $f(x) \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Similarly, by taking $x < x_0$ and making $x$ sufficiently negative, we can make $f(x)$ arbitrarily small, contradicting the assumption that $f(x) \\geq m$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that $f$ is bounded must be false. Hence, $f$ is unbounded.",
    "### Theorem\nSuppose $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function such that $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is unbounded.\n\n### Proof\nSince $f$ is differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$ and $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is strictly increasing on $\\mathbb{R}$. Let $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be any point. For any $M > f(x_0)$, there exists $x_1 > x_0$ such that $f(x_1) > M$. This follows from the Intermediate Value Theorem applied to the continuous function $f$ on the interval $[x_0, x_1]$ and the fact that $f$ is strictly increasing, ensuring that $f(x_1) > f(x_0)$ and thus $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily large by choosing $x_1$ sufficiently large.\n\nSimilarly, for any $m < f(x_0)$, there exists $x_2 < x_0$ such that $f(x_2) < m$ by the same reasoning but applied to the decreasing behavior of $f$ as we move to the left of $x_0$.\n\nTherefore, $f$ is unbounded above and unbounded below, which means $f$ is unbounded on $\\mathbb{R}$.",
    "### Theorem\nLet $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function. If $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is unbounded.\n\n### Proof\nAssume for contradiction that $f$ is bounded. Then there exists a real number $M > 0$ such that $|f(x)| \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is strictly increasing on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nConsider the interval $[0, N]$ for some $N > 0$. Since $f$ is continuous on $[0, N]$ and differentiable on $(0, N)$ with $f'(x) > 0$, by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a $c \\in (0, N)$ such that \n\\[f'(c) = \\frac{f(N) - f(0)}{N - 0} > 0.\\]\n\nAs $f$ is strictly increasing, $f(N) > f(0)$, and thus $f(N) - f(0) > 0$. Since $f'(c) > 0$, the difference $f(N) - f(0)$ must also increase as $N$ increases, and because $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, this difference continues to grow without bound as $N$ becomes arbitrarily large.\n\nTherefore, for a sufficiently large $N$, we must have $|f(N)| > M$, contradicting the assumption that $f$ is bounded. Hence, the function $f$ must be unbounded.\n"
