    "The polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals by Eisenstein's criterion applied to its reciprocal polynomial $x^4(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) = x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4$, after the change of variables $x \\mapsto x+1$. Specifically, for the reciprocal polynomial $x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4$, consider it as a polynomial in $x+1$. It becomes $(x+1)^8 + (x+1)^7 + (x+1)^6 + (x+1)^5 + (x+1)^4$, which can be expanded and simplified to a form where all terms, except the leading one, are divisible by 2, but not all coefficients are divisible by $2^2$.

    "## Theorem\nThe polynomial $p(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\n### Proof\nConsider the polynomial $p(x)$. Its reciprocal polynomial is given by $x^4p(\\frac{1}{x}) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$, which, after multiplying by $x^4$, becomes $x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4$. \n\nLet us perform a change of variables with $x \\mapsto x+1$. This substitution transforms the reciprocal polynomial into \n$$q(x) = (x+1)^8 + (x+1)^7 + (x+1)^6 + (x+1)^5 + (x+1)^4.$$ \n\nExpanding $q(x)$ and collecting like terms yields a polynomial where every term, except the leading term, is divisible by 2. Specifically, this is because the binomial expansion of each term $(x+1)^n$ for $n \\geq 4$ will include terms of the form $\\binom{n}{k}x^k$ for $1 \\leq k \\leq n$, and since $\\binom{n}{k}$ is even for $1 \\leq k < n$ when $n \\geq 4$, all coefficients, except for the leading coefficient, are divisible by 2. However, not all coefficients are divisible by $2^2$, since the constant term in the expansion will not be.\n\nAccording to Eisenstein's criterion, for a polynomial $f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1x + a_0$ with integer coefficients, if there exists a prime number $p$ such that $p \\mid a_i$ for all $i < n$, $p^2 \\not\\mid a_0$, and $p \\nmid a_n$, then $f(x)$ is irreducible over the rationals. \n\nApplying this criterion to $q(x)$, with $p=2$, it follows that $q(x)$, and hence the original polynomial $p(x)$, is irreducible over the rationals.",
    "### Theorem\nThe polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\n### Proof\nConsider the polynomial $g(x) = f(x-1) = (x-1)^4 + (x-1)^3 + (x-1)^2 + (x-1) + 1$. After expanding and simplifying, we obtain $g(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1$. We apply Eisenstein's criterion to $g(x)$ with the prime $p = 2$. The prime $p$ divides all the coefficients of $g(x)$ except for the leading coefficient. Moreover, $p^2 = 4$ does not divide the constant term, and the leading coefficient is not divisible by $p$. By Eisenstein's criterion, $g(x)$ is irreducible over the rationals. Since $g(x)$ is obtained from $f(x)$ by a change of variables, and irreducibility is preserved under such transformations, $f(x)$ is also irreducible over the rationals.",
    "### Theorem\nThe polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals.\n\n### Proof\nConsider the transformation $x = y + 1$. Applying this to the polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ results in the polynomial $((y + 1)^4 + (y + 1)^3 + (y + 1)^2 + (y + 1) + 1) - 1$, which simplifies to $(y + 1)^5 - 1$. Expanding this yields $y^5 + 5y^4 + 10y^3 + 10y^2 + 5y + 1 - 1 = y^5 + 5y^4 + 10y^3 + 10y^2 + 5y$. This is a consequence of the binomial theorem and the arithmetic operations performed.\n\nEisenstein's criterion states that a polynomial $p(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1x + a_0$ is irreducible over the rational numbers if there exists a prime number $p$ such that:\n\n1. $p$ divides $a_i$ for all $i < n$,\n2. $p$ does not divide $a_n$, and\n3. $p^2$ does not divide $a_0$.\n\nFor our transformed polynomial $y^5 + 5y^4 + 10y^3 + 10y^2 + 5y$, choosing $p = 5$ satisfies all three conditions of Eisenstein's criterion:\n\n1. $5$ divides all coefficients except the leading one ($5y^4$, $10y^3$, $10y^2$, $5y$).\n2. $5$ does not divide the coefficient of $y^5$ (which is 1).\n3. $5^2$ (or $25$) does not divide the constant term (since there is no constant term in this case, this condition is trivially met).\n\nTherefore, by Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial $y^5 + 5y^4 + 10y^3 + 10y^2 + 5y$ is irreducible over the rationals. Since the irreducibility of a polynomial is invariant under a linear change of variables, the original polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is also irreducible over the rationals."
