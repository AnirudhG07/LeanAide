    "The polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals by Eisenstein's criterion applied to its reciprocal polynomial $x^4(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) = x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4$, after the change of variables $x \\mapsto x+1$. Specifically, for the reciprocal polynomial $x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4$, consider it as a polynomial in $x+1$. It becomes $(x+1)^8 + (x+1)^7 + (x+1)^6 + (x+1)^5 + (x+1)^4$, which can be expanded and simplified to a form where all terms, except the leading one, are divisible by 2, but not all coefficients are divisible by $2^2$. Therefore, by Eisenstein's criterion, the original polynomial is irreducible over the rationals.",
    "To prove that the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals, consider the polynomial $g(x) = f(x-1) = (x-1)^4 + (x-1)^3 + (x-1)^2 + (x-1) + 1$. Expanding and simplifying, we get $g(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1$. Now, applying Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$, we observe that $p$ divides all the coefficients of $g(x)$ except the leading coefficient, $p^2$ does not divide the constant term, and the leading coefficient is not divisible by $p$. Therefore, $g(x)$ is irreducible over the rationals, which implies that $f(x)$ is also irreducible over the rationals.",
    "The polynomial $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over the rationals by applying Eisenstein's criterion to the polynomial $x^4(x + 1) + x^3(x + 1) + x^2(x + 1) + x(x + 1) + (x + 1) = x^5 - 1$, after substituting $x = y+1$, which gives $y^5 + 5y^4 + 10y^3 + 10y^2 + 5y$. Since 5 is a prime that divides all the coefficients except the leading one and does not divide the constant term squared, the original polynomial is irreducible over the rationals."
