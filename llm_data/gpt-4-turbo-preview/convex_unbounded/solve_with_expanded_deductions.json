    "### Theorem\nLet $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function such that $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Then $f$ is unbounded.\n\n### Proof\nAssume for contradiction that $f$ is bounded. Thus, there exist real numbers $M$ and $m$ such that for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $m \\leq f(x) \\leq M$. Since $f$ is continuous on the connected set $\\mathbb{R}$, the image $f(\\mathbb{R})$ is connected, implying $f(\\mathbb{R})$ is an interval. The boundedness of $f$ indicates that $f(\\mathbb{R})$ is the closed interval $[m, M]$.\n\nGiven $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is strictly convex. This property entails that for any $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $x_1 < x_2$, the graph of $f$ for $x \\in (x_1, x_2)$ lies strictly below the line segment connecting $(x_1, f(x_1))$ and $(x_2, f(x_2))$. Hence, $f$ cannot attain both a maximum and a minimum on $\\mathbb{R}$, as a strictly convex function does not allow for such extremal values to coexist over the entire real line.\n\nHowever, the assumption of boundedness contradicts the nature of strict convexity by implying the existence of both a global maximum and minimum, which is impossible for a strictly convex function. This contradiction suggests that the original assumption of $f$ being bounded is false. Therefore, $f$ must be unbounded.",
    "### Theorem 1\nIf $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function such that $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is unbounded.\n\n#### Proof\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that $f$ is bounded. Given that $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, it follows that $f$ is strictly convex. This strict convexity implies for any three points $x_1 < x_2 < x_3$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, the slope of the secant line connecting the points $(x_1, f(x_1))$ and $(x_3, f(x_3))$ is greater than the slope of the secant line connecting the points $(x_1, f(x_1))$ and $(x_2, f(x_2))$, i.e.,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f(x_3) - f(x_1)}{x_3 - x_1} > \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}.\n\\]\n\nThis property leads to the conclusion that as $x$ tends to infinity, the slope of these secant lines, which approach the slope of the tangent lines due to the differentiability of $f$, must also tend to infinity. This means that the rate of increase of $f(x)$ as $x \\to \\infty$ has no upper bound, contradicting the assumption that $f$ is bounded above.\n\nSimilarly, considering $x$ tending to $-\\infty$, the slope of the secant lines (and hence the tangent lines) indicates that $f(x)$ decreases without bound, contradicting the assumption that $f$ is bounded below.\n\nTherefore, under the assumption that $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the function $f$ must be unbounded.",
    "### Theorem\nLet \\(f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) be a continuous function with \\(f''(x) > 0\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).

Hence, there exist \\(M, m \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(m \\leq f(x) \\leq M\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nGiven \\(f''(x) > 0\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), it follows that \\(f'\\) is strictly increasing over \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Consequently, for any \\(x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) with \\(x_1 < x_2\\), \\(f'(x_1) < f'(x_2)\\).\n\nThe strict monotonicity of \\(f'\\) implies that \\(f\\) does not have two distinct points \\(x_1, x_2\\) (where \\(x_1 < x_2\\)) such that \\(f(x_1) = f(x_2)\\).
