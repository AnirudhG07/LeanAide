    "Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $f$ is bounded. Then there exist real numbers $M$ and $m$ such that $m \\leq f(x) \\leq M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Since $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{R}$ is connected, $f(\\mathbb{R})$ is also connected in $\\mathbb{R}$, implying that $f(\\mathbb{R})$ is an interval. Given that $f(\\mathbb{R})$ is bounded and connected, it must be a closed interval $[m, M]$. \n\nBecause $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is strictly convex. This means that for any two points $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, with $x_1 < x_2$, the line segment connecting $(x_1, f(x_1))$ and $(x_2, f(x_2))$ lies above the graph of $f$ for all $x \\in (x_1, x_2)$. This implies that $f$ cannot have both a maximum and a minimum value in $\\mathbb{R}$ since a strict convex function is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing beyond some points on the real line. \n\nHowever, our assumption that $f$ is bounded above by $M$ and below by $m$ implies that $f$ has both a maximum and a minimum value in $\\mathbb{R}$, which contradicts the property of strict convexity. This contradiction arises from the assumption that $f$ is bounded. Therefore, $f$ must be unbounded.",
    "Assume for contradiction that $f$ is bounded. Since $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is strictly convex. This implies that for any $x_1 < x_2 < x_3$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, the slope of the secant line through $(x_1, f(x_1))$ and $(x_3, f(x_3))$ is greater than the slope of the secant line through $(x_1, f(x_1))$ and $(x_2, f(x_2))$, i.e.,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{f(x_3) - f(x_1)}{x_3 - x_1} > \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}.\n\\]\n\nThis can be extended to show that as $x \\to \\infty$, the slope of the secant lines, and hence the tangents (since $f$ is differentiable as a consequence of $f$ being twice differentiable), approach infinity, which contradicts the boundedness of $f$. Similarly, as $x \\to -\\infty$, the slope of the secant lines indicates that $f$ must decrease without bound, again contradicting the boundedness of $f$. Therefore, $f$ must be unbounded.",
    "Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that \\(f\\) is bounded. Then, there exist real numbers \\(M\\) and \\(m\\) such that \\(m \\leq f(x) \\leq M\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nSince \\(f\\) is continuous on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and differentiable with \\(f''(x) > 0\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), \\(f'\\) is strictly increasing on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). This means that for any \\(x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) with \\(x_1 < x_2\\), we have \\(f'(x_1) < f'(x_2)\\).\n\nIf \\(f'\\) is strictly increasing, then there cannot exist two points \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) (with \\(x_1 < x_2\\)) such that \\(f(x_1) = f(x_2)\\), because that would imply \\(f'\\) has a zero between \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) (by Rolle's Theorem), contradicting the fact that \\(f'\\) must be strictly increasing or decreasing between any two points due to \\(f'' > 0\\).\n\nThus, \\(f\\) must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing over the entire real line. In either case, \\(f\\) cannot be bounded as it must approach either \\(\\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(\\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\), respectively. This contradicts our assumption that \\(f\\) is bounded. Therefore, \\(f\\) must be unbounded."
