    "### Theorem\nLet $A$ be a square matrix. If $A^2$ is invertible, then $A$ is invertible.\n\n### Proof\nAssume $A^2$ is invertible. By definition, this means there exists a matrix $B$ such that $A^2B = I$ and $BA^2 = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nConsider the matrix $C = AB$. We compute $AC$ as follows:\n$$\nAC = A(AB) = A^2B = I.\n$$\nThe equation $AC = I$ shows that a right inverse for $A$ exists, which is $C = AB$.\n\nGiven that $A$ is a square matrix, the existence of a right inverse for $A$ implies that $A$ also has a left inverse. This conclusion is supported by the rank-nullity theorem or by considering the determinant of $A$. \n\nTherefore, $A$ is invertible, completing the proof.",
