    "Assume $A^2$ is invertible. Then there exists a matrix $B$ such that $A^2B = BA^2 = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nLet $C = AB$. Then, we see that $AC = A(AB) = A^2B = I$.\n\nThus, a right inverse for $A$ exists. Since $A$ is a square matrix, the existence of a right inverse also implies the existence of a left inverse (this follows from the rank-nullity theorem or by considering the determinant of $A$), thus proving $A$ is invertible.",
    "Assume $A^2$ is invertible. This means there exists a matrix $B$ such that $A^2 B = BA^2 = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. Notice that $A(A B) = (AA)B = A^2B = I$. Hence, $AB$ is the inverse of $A$, which proves $A$ is invertible.",
    "If $A^2$ is invertible, then there exists a matrix $B$ such that $A^2B = BA^2 = I$ where $I$ is the identity matrix. Now consider the matrix $AB$. We have $(AB)A = A(BA) = A^2B = I$. Thus, $A$ has a right inverse. Similarly, considering $BA$, we get $A(BA) = (AB)A = I$, demonstrating that $A$ also has a left inverse. Therefore, $A$ is invertible."
