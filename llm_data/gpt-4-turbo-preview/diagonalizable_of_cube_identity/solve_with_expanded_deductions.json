    "Since $A^3 = I$, $A$ satisfies the polynomial equation $p(x) = x^3 - 1$. The roots of $p(x)$ are the cube roots of unity, namely $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity. These roots are distinct, so the minimal polynomial of $A$ must divide $p(x)$ and also have distinct roots. Therefore, $A$ is diagonalizable.",
    "Since $A^3 = I$, $A$ satisfies the polynomial equation $x^3 - 1 = 0$.

    "### Theorem\nLet $A$ be a square matrix. If $A^3 = I$, then $A$ is diagonalizable.\n\n### Proof\nAssume $A^3 = I$. This implies that $A$ satisfies the polynomial equation $p(x) = x^3 - 1$. We can factor $p(x)$ as $p(x) = (x-1)(x-\\omega)(x-\\omega^2)$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity, indicating the roots of $p(x)$ are the cube roots of unity: $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$. These roots are distinct.\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, every polynomial equation of degree $n$ has exactly $n$ roots in the complex numbers (counting multiplicity). Hence, the polynomial $p(x)$ has three distinct roots. By the definition of the minimal polynomial of a matrix, the minimal polynomial of $A$ must divide any polynomial for which the matrix is a root, including $p(x)$. Since the roots of $p(x)$ are distinct, the minimal polynomial of $A$ must also have distinct roots (as it divides $p(x)$ and thus can only have roots that are also roots of $p(x)$).\n\nA matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial is a product of distinct linear factors. Given that the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $p(x)$ and must have distinct roots (as shown above), it follows that it is a product of distinct linear factors. Therefore, $A$ is diagonalizable.",
    "### Theorem 1\nLet $A$ be a square matrix such that $A^3 = I$. Then $A$ is diagonalizable over the complex numbers.\n\n#### Proof\nConsider the polynomial $p(x) = x^3 - 1$. Since $A^3 = I$, $A$ satisfies $p(A) = A^3 - I = 0$. The roots of $p(x)$ are the cube roots of unity: $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$ is a primitive third root of unity. Therefore, $p(x)$ can be factored as $p(x) = (x - 1)(x - \\omega)(x - \\omega^2)$, indicating that $p(x)$ has distinct roots.\n\nA matrix is diagonalizable over the complex numbers if its minimal polynomial splits into distinct linear factors over the complex numbers. Since the minimal polynomial of $A$ must divide $p(x)$, which itself splits into distinct linear factors, it follows that the minimal polynomial of $A$ also consists of distinct linear factors.\n\nHence, by the criterion for diagonalizability, $A$ is diagonalizable over the complex numbers.",
