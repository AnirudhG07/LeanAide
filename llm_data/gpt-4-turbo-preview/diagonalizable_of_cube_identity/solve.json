    "Since $A^3 = I$, $A$ satisfies the polynomial equation $p(x) = x^3 - 1$. The roots of $p(x)$ are the cube roots of unity, namely $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity. These roots are distinct, so the minimal polynomial of $A$ must divide $p(x)$ and also have distinct roots. Therefore, $A$ is diagonalizable.",
    "Since $A^3 = I$, $A$ satisfies the polynomial equation $x^3 - 1 = 0$. The roots of this polynomial are the three cube roots of unity, i.e., $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$ is a primitive third root of unity. Hence, the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x - \\omega)(x - \\omega^2)$. Since $x^3-1$ has distinct roots, its factors are distinct linear factors, which means the minimal polynomial of $A$ must also split into distinct linear factors over the complex numbers.\n\nA fundamental result in linear algebra states that a matrix is diagonalizable over the complex numbers if and only if its minimal polynomial can be expressed as a product of distinct linear factors. Since we have shown that the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides a polynomial that splits into distinct linear factors, it follows that $A$ is diagonalizable over the complex numbers.",
    "Given $A^3 = I$, we need to show $A$ is diagonalizable.\n\nThe minimal polynomial of $A$, $m_A(x)$, divides $x^3 - 1$. Factoring $x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)$, we notice that the roots of $x^3 - 1 = 0$ are distinct (1, a complex root $\\omega$, and $\\omega^2$ where $\\omega$ is a primitive third root of unity). Thus, the minimal polynomial $m_A(x)$ has distinct roots, implying $A$ is diagonalizable."
