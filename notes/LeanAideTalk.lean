# Overview

- `LeanAIde` is a tool to translate
  mathematical statements from natural language
  to Lean code.
- The tool is itself written in `Lean 4`.
- At its core, `LeanAIde` relies on a 
  large language model for translation.
- Various optimisations to the input and output of
  the language model are used to push up 
  the success rate of translation.

#slides Prompting /-!

# Prompting

The prompting style used to query 
a language model can have a
strong effect on the output.

A few possible prompting styles for autoformalisation include:

- Direct (zero-shot) prompting
- Fixed few-shot prompting
- Input-dependent promptings

# The design

- Receive the input statement from the user through the Lean editor.
- Gather documentation strings from `mathlib` with similar content.
- Assemble a prompt from these doc-strings and query the language model.
- Post-process the outputs and retain only those corresponding to well-formed Lean expressions.
- Pick an output representing the most common translation and display it in the Lean editor.

# Sentence embeddings

Sentence embeddings are numerical representations of text
as vectors of real numbers in a way that captures 
semantic relationships between them.

The embedding of the input statement is computed (using OpenAI embeddings)
and compared with stored embeddings of
`Mathlib` doc-strings to identify the most similar ones., i.e.,

# Prompting

The prompt to the language model is assembled from the sentence embeddings
as an alternating dialogue of doc-strings ("from the user") and their corresponding Lean formal statements ("from the assistant").

This is sent as a query to the `OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo` or `GPT-4` language model via an API call.

Additional configuration options permit adding a few fixed examples to the prompt
and also using theorems with doc-strings from the current editor window.

# Post-processing

A large part of the Lean mathematics library
was developed in the `Lean 3` proof assistant,
before recently transitioning to `Lean 4`.

As `Lean 3` code forms a larger portion of the 
model's training data, we post-process the output
to transform any `Lean 3` syntax into `Lean 4`.

# Elaboration filtering

Additionally, we retain only those
outputs of the language model that correspond to
well-formed Lean expressions.

As `Lean` is a dependently typed language,
this is a very strong condition.

# Output

After post-processing and filtering, the final output is picked by *majority voting*, i.e.,

- the statements are clustered by proved equivalence using 
the `aesop` automation tool and 
- a representative of the most common translation is then presented to the user.

#slides Evaluation /-!

# Evaluation

The `LeanAIde` tool is tested against two datasets:

- A custom data-set of around 120 theorem statements at the undergraudate level
- The `ProofNet` benchmark for statement autoformalisation

# Custom Dataset

The custom data-set of 120 statements is split into three categories:

- normal statements
- "silly" statements
- false statements

The last two categories are specifically to guard against data contamination.

# ProofNet

A benchmark for statement autoformalisation
consisting of 371 theorem statements drawn from
various undergraduate pure mathematics textbooks.

# Results

  let idx ← IO.rand 0 (lines.length - 1) 
  return lines[idx]!

#slides Conclusion /-!

## Summary

`LeanAIde` is a tool for translating
natural language theorem statements to Lean code,
with a success rate high enough
to be of possible practical use.

The tool crucially relies on
several distinctive features of the Lean theorem prover,
including its programming and meta-programming capabilities
and its the vast and unified mathematics library.

## Language models and proof assistants

There is potential for combining
languages models with proof assistants for
tasks such as

- Autoformalisation
- Code completions and debugging
- Navigating libraries of formal mathematics
- Suggesting new lemmas during formalisation

Such tools can make formalisation of mathematics
vastly more approachable.
