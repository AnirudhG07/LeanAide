## End-to-End Proof Generation

* As a tour of much of the relevant code and remaining tasks, we will consider the end-to-end proof generation process.
* Here, we start with a problem statement and end with Lean code.
* We will eventually consider even broader problems.
* A lot of the code is also for data generation for tasks not directly related to this goal, and in some cases abandoned.

---

## Steps in End-to-End Proof Generation

* Given a statement, we ask the language model to generate a proof.
* We then ask for a structured proof in a custom JSON format.
  * This in particular records errors and missing proofs.
* For code generation, we need auxiliary tasks:
  * Translation of statements.
  * Search for statements that are used: if this fails we go back to generating a proof.
* We then generate Lean code from the structured proof.
* The generated code has many invocations of a `auto` tactic.

---

## Core task: Structured Proof Generation

* The prompt is output by Lean code, also ported to Python.
* This allows rapid and clean variations, as also specializations.
* We may want multiple passes, both for reported errors and insufficient details.
* Tasks:
  * [ ] How reliable is the reporting of errors?
  * [ ] Improve the reporting of errors by varying prompts.
  * [ ] Develop multi-round structured proof generation.
  * [ ] Improve the quality of the structured proof.

---

## Core task: Translation of Statements

* This has been the central task for a long time, and also the main focus in the ARCNet work so far.
* The task is to translate mathematics to a **single theorem** or a **single definition**.
* The source may be more complex.
* If the appropriate target is not a single theorem or definition, we need to decompose the problem.
* We will return to this after considering the other tasks.

---

## Core task: Code Generation

* Given the JSON structured proof, we generate Lean code.
* There is a core skeleton, but with known errors.
* Tasks:
  * [ ] Fix the known error: fill in variables in statements. The present approach should be modified.
  * [ ] Locate and fix other errors, extending to a greater range of statements.
  * [ ] Specifically, work with the Berkeley qualifier exam problems - this will be together with improving structured proof generation.

---

## Core task: Search for Statements

* A statement in a mathematical proof is often an assertion with results from which it follows.
* We need to find these results in `Mathlib` if they are present.
* The current methods are:
  * Use `leansearch` and `moogle` and pick the best results.
  * Among a larger set of results, use a language model to pick ones that match the statement.
  * This larger set can also use embeddings for finding candidates.
* Tasks:
  * [ ] Improve the search for statements.

---

## Core task: Proof Automation

* At present proof automation is done using the `aesop` tactic.
  * Aesop *rules* are generated, including various powerful tactics.
  * The rules also depend on identifying relevant theorems.
* Tasks:
  * [ ] Evaluate, indeed debug, the current proof automation.
  * [ ] Improve the interface with Aesop.
  * [ ] Use `duper` as well.

---

## Central task: Translation of Statements

### Outline of translation

* We build a prompt using *examples* nearby definitions and theorems.
  * Nearby definitions are found using *embeddings*.
* In addition, we can include relevant definitions.
* There are choices in the format of the prompt.
* We can also *roundtrip* - translate the Lean code back to natural language and compare.

---

## Improving the Translation

* We run in bulk to get a sense of the quality and narrow failures.
* For each failure, we try to understand the cause.
* Conjecture a fix if we can - otherwise note this as a hard case to return to.
* Make manual changes and test.
* Automate the fix if possible.
  * Recognize the failure mode.
  * Generate a fix.
  * Add fix to the translation code.

---

### Cause of failure: missing definitions

* A needed definition may not be in the prompt, or may not be picked up by the language model.
* There are various forms for this:
  * Definition in `Mathlib` but not in the prompt - for example *circle*.
  * No definition in `Mathlib` - for example *diagonalizable*.
  * Definition included in the statement but not separated out.
* A partial fix for the first case was to generate more documentation strings using a language model.

--- 

### Fixing missing definitions

* In each case, we have the four steps.
* For a definition missing from `Mathlib`, we can:
  * Translate the definition.
  * Add the definition to the prompt.
* For a definition that is not found, we can:
  * Use other searches, such as based on mathematical terms.
  * Improve embeddings.
* For definitions that are not separated out, we can:
  * Use a language model to separate out definitions.
  * Translate and use the definition.

---

### Cause of failure: Lean syntax errors

* Three cases we have seen:
  * `∃!` with multiple arguments.
  * `*` used for multiplication.
  * Typeclass notation used in `Exists`.
* In each case, it seems we can (**tasks**):
  * Recognize the error.
  * Use Lean's parser to fix the error.

---

### Cause of failure: logical errors (oversimplification)

* The following was handled badly:
  * Translating "The greatest odd divisor of 36 is 9" results in hallucination of terms `greatestOddDivisor` or similar terms.
  * The sentence: "The greatest odd number that is a divisor of 36 is 9" gets translated to `∀ (d : ℕ), d ∣ 36 ∧ d % 2 = 1 → d ≤ 9`, which misses the part that 9 is a divisor of 36.
  * The sentence: "The odd number n such that n is a divisor of 36 and such that n is greater than or equal to every other odd number k that is also a divisor of 36 is 9." gets correctly translated to `∀ (n : ℕ), (Odd n ∧ n ∣ 36 ∧ ∀ (k : ℕ), Odd k → k ∣ 36 → k ≤ n) ↔ n = 9`.
* One can try to fix this by rewriting the sentence to be more explicit.

---

## Translation fixing workflow

* Gather errors in `translation-failures.md`.
* Fill in details.
* Work out, test and automate fixes.

---

## Other tasks

* [ ] Use newer embeddings, merging the sources or working with both.
* [ ] Add documentation throughout the relevant code.
