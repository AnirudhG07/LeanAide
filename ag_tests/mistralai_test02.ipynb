Prove that $f$ is unbounded.\\n## Proof: \\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $f$ is bounded. Then there exist real numbers $M$ and $m$ such that $m \\\\leq f(x) \\\\leq M$ for all $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$. Since $f$ is continuous on $\\\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\\\mathbb{R}$ is connected, $f(\\\\mathbb{R})$ is also connected in $\\\\mathbb{R}$, implying that $f(\\\\mathbb{R})$ is an interval. Given that $f(\\\\mathbb{R})$ is bounded and connected, it must be a closed interval $[m, M]$. \\n\\nBecause $f\\'\\'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is strictly convex. This means that for any two points $x_1, x_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$, with $x_1 < x_2$, the line segment connecting $(x_1, f(x_1))$ and $(x_2, f(x_2))$ lies above the graph of $f$ for all $x \\\\in (x_1, x_2)$. This implies that $f$ cannot have both a maximum and a minimum value in $\\\\mathbb{R}$ since a strict convex function is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing beyond some points on the real line. \\n\\nHowever, our assumption that $f$ is bounded above by $M$ and below by $m$ implies that $f$ has both a maximum and a minimum value in $\\\\mathbb{R}$, which contradicts the property of strict convexity. This contradiction arises from the assumption that $f$ is bounded. Therefore, $f$ must be unbounded.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nWrite the following proof in the JSON format.

The roots of this polynomial are the three cube roots of unity, i.e., $1, \\\\omega, \\\\omega^2$, where $\\\\omega = e^{2\\\\pi i/3}$ is a primitive third root of unity. Hence, the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x - \\\\omega)(x - \\\\omega^2)$. Since $x^3-1$ has distinct roots, its factors are distinct linear factors, which means the minimal polynomial of $A$ must also split into distinct linear factors over the complex numbers.\\n\\nA fundamental result in linear algebra states that a matrix is diagonalizable over the complex numbers if and only if its minimal polynomial can be expressed as a product of distinct linear factors. Since we have shown that the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides a polynomial that splits into distinct linear factors, it follows that $A$ is diagonalizable over the complex numbers.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nWrite the following proof in the JSON format.
