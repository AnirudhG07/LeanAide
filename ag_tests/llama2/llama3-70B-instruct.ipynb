The roots of this polynomial are the three cube roots of unity, i.e., $1, \\\\omega, \\\\omega^2$, where $\\\\omega = e^{2\\\\pi i/3}$ is a primitive third root of unity. Hence, the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x - \\\\omega)(x - \\\\omega^2)$. Since $x^3-1$ has distinct roots, its factors are distinct linear factors, which means the minimal polynomial of $A$ must also split into distinct linear factors over the complex numbers.\\n\\nA fundamental result in linear algebra states that a matrix is diagonalizable over the complex numbers if and only if its minimal polynomial can be expressed as a product of distinct linear factors. Since we have shown that the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides a polynomial that splits into distinct linear factors, it follows that $A$ is diagonalizable over the complex numbers.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nWrite the following proof in the JSON format.
