## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=x \) and \( \dot{y}=y). Prove that the origin is source.


## Proof: b) $\dot{x} = x \qquad \dot{y} = y$

$\dot{X} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} X$
$trace = 2 \qquad \Delta = 1$
$eigenvalues = (1, 1)$

$eigenvectors \to$ all of $\mathbb{R}^2$ (since it is the identity matrix)

$\implies$ It is a source.
