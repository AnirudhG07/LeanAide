## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=x \) and \( \dot{y}=y). Prove that the origin is source.


## Proof: b) 

$\dot{x} = x$
$\dot{y} = y$

$\dot{X} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} X$ 
trace = 2 $\Delta = 1$
eigenvalues = (1, 1)
eigenvectors $\rightarrow$ all of $\mathbb{R}^2$
(since it is the identity matrix)

$\rightarrow$ it is a source.
