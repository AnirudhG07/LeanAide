## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=x \) and \( \dot{y}=y). Prove that the origin is source.


## Proof: $$
\dot{x} = x \qquad \dot{y} = y
$$
$$
\dot{X'} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{bmatrix} X
$$
This has repeating real eigenvalues. $\lambda = 1$. Every vector $V \in \mathbb{R}^2$ is an eigenvector as
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} V = V
$$.
Therefore the solution for this system is 
$$
X(t) = \alpha e^t V + t V e^{Rt^2}.
$$
These are straight line solutions moving away from the origin. This system is a source.
