## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=x \) and \( \dot{y}=y). Prove that the origin is source.


## Proof: (b) $\dot{x} = x$, $\dot{y} = y$

$X' = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} X$

This has repeating real eigenvalues. $\lambda = 1$

Every vector $V \in \mathbb{R}^2$ is an eigenvector as 
$\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} V = V$

The solution for this system is
$X(t) = \alpha e^t V + t V e^{Rt^2}$ 

These are straight line solutions moving away from the origin.

This system is a source.
