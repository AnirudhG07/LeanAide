## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=x \) and \( \dot{y}=y). Prove that the origin is source.


## Proof: b) $\dot{x} = x$ and $\dot{y} = y$ 

=> $\frac{dx}{dt} = x$ 
=> $\frac{dy}{dt} = y$

=> $\frac{dx}{x} = dt$
=>  $\frac{dy}{y} = dt$

=> $log \frac{x}{x_0} = t + c_1$
=> $log \frac{y}{y_0} = t + c_2$

=> $\frac{x}{x_0} = Ae^t$
=> $\frac{y}{y_0} = Be^t$

=> It's a saddle saddle

where $x_0, y_0$ were initial points.
