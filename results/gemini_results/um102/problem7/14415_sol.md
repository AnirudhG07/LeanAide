## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=x \) and \( \dot{y}=y). Prove that the origin is source.


## Proof: b) $\dot{x} = x$ and $\dot{y} = y$

$\implies \frac{dx}{dt} = x$ 

$\implies  \frac{dx}{x} = dt$

$\implies  log \frac{x}{x_0} = t + c_1$

$\implies x = Ae^t$

$\frac{dy}{dt} = y$

$\frac{dy}{y} = dt$

$log \frac{y}{y_0} = t + c_2$

$\frac{y}{y_0} = Be^t$

$\implies$ It's a saddle 

where $x_0$, $y_0$ were initial points.
