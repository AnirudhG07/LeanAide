## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=x \) and \( \dot{y}=y). Prove that the origin is source.


## Proof: (b) $\dot{x} = x$ and $\dot{y} = y$
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\implies \frac{dx}{dt} = x & \frac{dy}{dt} = y \\
&\implies \log\frac{dx}{x} = dt & \frac{dy}{y} = dt \\
&\implies \log \frac{x}{x_0} = t + c & \log \frac{y}{y_0} = t + c_1\\
&\implies \frac{x}{x_0} = Ae^t & \frac{y}{y_0} = Be^t \\
&\implies \text{It's a saddle}
\end{aligned}
$$
where $x_0$, $y_0$ were initial points.
