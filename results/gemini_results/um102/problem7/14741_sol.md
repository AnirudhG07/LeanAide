## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=x \) and \( \dot{y}=y). Prove that the origin is source.


## Proof: **Problem:**

Solve the system of differential equations:

$$\dot{x} = x$$
$$\dot{y} = y$$

**Solution:**

We can rewrite the system in matrix form as:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}$$

or

$$\dot{v} = Av$$

where $v = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}$ and $A = I = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$.

The eigenvalue of $A$ is $\lambda = 1$ and the eigenspace is 2-dimensional. We can choose the eigenvectors $v_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$.

Solving the differential equation $\frac{dx}{dt} = x$ gives us $x = c_1 e^t$.

Similarly, solving $\frac{dy}{dt} = y$ gives us $y = c_2 e^t$.

Therefore, the general solution is:

$$y = \frac{c_2}{c_1} x = kx$$

where $k = \frac{c_2}{c_1}$ is a constant.

We can also note that both $|x|$ and $|y|$ increase as $t$ increases.

The trajectories of the system are straight lines emerging from the origin, which is a source.
