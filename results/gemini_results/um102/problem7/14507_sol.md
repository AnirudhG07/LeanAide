## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=x \) and \( \dot{y}=y). Prove that the origin is source.


## Proof: (b) 
$\dot{x} = x$
$\dot{y} = y$

$X' = AX$
$\begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}$

The eigenvalues are repeated, $\lambda = 1$. Every vector is an eigenvector of the identity transform. 

$X(t) = V_0 e^{\lambda t} \rightarrow \infty$ as  $t \rightarrow \infty$
$\rightarrow V_0$ as 

This is a diverging dynamical system, and since each phase line is concurrent at the origin. The origin acts as a source.
