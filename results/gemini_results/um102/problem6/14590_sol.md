## Theorem: Consider the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=y \) and \( \dot{y}=x). Prove that the origin is saddle.



## Proof: **Problem 50:**

We are given the following system of differential equations:

$$\dot{x} = y$$
$$\dot{y} = x$$

**Solution:**

Let  $\dot{X} = \begin{pmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \end{pmatrix}$ and $X = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}$. Then we can rewrite the system in matrix form:

$$\dot{X} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} X.$$

The trace of the matrix is 0 and the determinant is -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, the equilibrium point at the origin is a **saddle**.
