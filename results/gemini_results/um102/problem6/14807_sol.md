## Theorem: Consider the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=y \) and \( \dot{y}=x). Prove that the origin is saddle.



## Proof: Let's determine the eigenvalues of the matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.

To find the eigenvalues, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by:

  $|A - \lambda I| = 0$

where $I$ is the identity matrix of the same size as $A$.

Substituting the matrix $A$ and expanding the determinant, we get:

  $\begin{vmatrix} -\lambda & 1 \\ 1 & -\lambda \end{vmatrix} = 0$

This simplifies to:

  $\lambda^2 - 1 = 0$

Solving this quadratic equation, we find:

  $\lambda = \pm 1$

Therefore, the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ are $\lambda_1 = 1$ and  $\lambda_2 = -1$.

Since one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, we can conclude that the system has a saddle point.
