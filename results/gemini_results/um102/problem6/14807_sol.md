## Theorem: Consider the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=y \) and \( \dot{y}=x). Prove that the origin is saddle.



## Proof: Question 5, part (a): 
The system is given by
$\dot{x} = y$,
$\dot{y} = x$.

This can be written in matrix form as
$(\begin{matrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \end{matrix}) = (\begin{matrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{matrix}) (\begin{matrix} x \\ y \end{matrix})$.

Denote the matrix by $A$. Thus,
$X' = AX$.

Finding the eigenvalues of $A$: 

The characteristic equation is
$|A-\lambda I| = 0$.
That is, 
$|\begin{matrix} -\lambda & 1 \\ 1 & -\lambda\end{matrix}| = \lambda^2 - 1 = 0$.

Therefore, the eigenvalues are
$\lambda = \pm 1$, that is, $\lambda_1 = 1, \lambda_2 = -1$. 

Since $\lambda_1 < 0 < \lambda_2$, 
the system has a saddle at the origin.
