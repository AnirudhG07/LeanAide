## Theorem: Consider the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=y \) and \( \dot{y}=x). Prove that the origin is saddle.



## Proof: (a) $x \dot{=} y$ and $\dot{y} \dot{=} n$.

$\dot{n} \dot{=} y$.  
$\frac{dn}{du} \dot{=} y$.

$dn \dot{=} y \, dy$.

$\int dn \dot{=} \int y \, dy$.

$n \dot{=} \frac{y^2}{2}$.

$y^2 \dot{=} 2n$.

The graph will be a parabola symmetric to $x$ axis.

$\dot{y} \dot{=} n$.
$\frac{dy}{dn} \dot{=} n$.

$dy \dot{=} n \, dn$.

$\int dy \dot{=} \int n \, dn$.

$y \dot{=} \frac{n^2}{2}$.

$n^2 \dot{=} 2y$.

The graph will be a parabola symmetric to $y$ axis.

$y^2 - 2x \dot{=} 0$.

$y^2 - 2n \dot{=} -2 \gamma$.

$f \dot{=} n^2 - y^2 + 2n - 2y \dot{=} 0$.

$\nabla (n^2 + 2n - y^2 - 2y) \dot{=} ((2n + 2)\hat{n} - (2y + 2)\hat{y})$

At origin $\nabla f \dot{=} 2\hat{n} - 2 \hat{y}$.

$x^2 - 2y \dot{=} 0$.

The sign will be a source.

## Cleaned-up Mathematical Proof:

**(a)** Given $x$ is proportional to $y$ and $\dot{y}$ is proportional to $n$, we have the following relationships: $x \propto y$ and $\dot{y} \propto n$.

Let's first consider $\dot{n} \propto y$. This translates to $\frac{dn}{du} \propto y$. We can rewrite this as  $dn \propto y \, dy$. Integrating both sides, we obtain $\int dn \propto \int y \, dy$, which leads to $n \propto \frac{y^2}{2}$. Consequently, we have $y^2 \propto 2n$.  This equation represents a parabola that is symmetric with respect to the $x$-axis.

Now, let's analyze $\dot{y} \propto n$, which can be expressed as $\frac{dy}{dn} \propto n$.  This implies $dy \propto n \, dn$. Integrating both sides yields $\int dy \propto \int n \, dn$, resulting in $y \propto \frac{n^2}{2}$. Consequently, we obtain $n^2 \propto 2y$.  This equation describes a parabola that is symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis.

Considering the equation $y^2 - 2x = 0$, we can express it as $y^2 - 2n = -2\gamma$. 

Let's define a function $f$ as $f = n^2 - y^2 + 2n - 2y = 0$. 

The gradient of $f$ is given by $\nabla (n^2 + 2n - y^2 - 2y) = ((2n + 2)\hat{n} - (2y + 2)\hat{y})$.

At the origin, the gradient becomes $\nabla f = 2\hat{n} - 2 \hat{y}$.

Considering another equation $x^2 - 2y = 0$, we can analyze the sign.

Based on the calculations, the sign will be a source.
