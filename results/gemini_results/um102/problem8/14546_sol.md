## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=-y \) and \( \dot{y}=x). Prove that the origin is circulation.


## Proof: It seems like the image contains a mix of mathematical notations and handwritten text that is difficult to interpret precisely. The provided information is not sufficient to construct a clean and coherent mathematical proof. 

However, I can point out some recognizable elements:

* A matrix is defined:  $A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$
* There is a mention of "eigenvalues" suggesting an eigenvalue problem.
* The expression $X(t) = e^{ \lambda t} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{pmatrix}$ suggests a solution to a system of differential equations.
* Trigonometric functions like  *cos* and *sin* appear, indicating a possible connection to oscillations or rotations.

To generate a meaningful proof, we would need:

1. **Clear problem statement:** What needs to be proven?
2. **Complete steps:**  The image shows fragments; we need all steps connected logically.
3. **Context:** What are the variables, assumptions, and previous results used?

Please provide more context or a clearer image if you wish to reconstruct the full mathematical argument.
