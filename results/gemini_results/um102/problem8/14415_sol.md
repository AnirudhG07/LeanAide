## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=-y \) and \( \dot{y}=x). Prove that the origin is circulation.


## Proof: Given the system of equations: 
 $$\dot{x} = -y$$
 $$\dot{y} = x$$
 we can substitute the second equation into the first to obtain:
 $$\ddot{x} = -x$$.
 Therefore:
 $$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -x$$.
