## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=-y \) and \( \dot{y}=x). Prove that the origin is circulation.


## Proof: We have $j=n$.
Also, $i=-y$.
Thus $\frac{dn}{dy}=-y$, so $dn=-ydy$.
Hence $\int dn =\int -ydy$, which implies that $n=\frac{-y^2}{2}$.
Therefore $2n=-y^2$.

Now, since $j=n$, we see that $\frac{dy}{dn}=n$, so $dy=ndn$.
Hence $\int dy = \int ndn$, which gives us that $y=\frac{n^2}{2}$.
Therefore $2y=n^2$, hence $n^2-2y=0$.

We know that $y^2+2n=0$. 
Also, $y^2+2n=n^2-2y$.
Thus $x^2-y^2-2x-2y=0$, so $x^2-2x-(y^2+2y)=0=f$.
Hence $\nabla f = 2n-2-(2y+2)=2x-2y-4$.
At the origin $\nabla f = -4$.
Therefore, at the origin it is a source.
