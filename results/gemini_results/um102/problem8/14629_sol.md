## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=-y \) and \( \dot{y}=x). Prove that the origin is circulation.


## Proof: We have $j = n$ and $i = -y$.  Then
\[\frac{dn}{dy} = -y\]and
\[\frac{dy}{dn} = n.\]Hence, $dn = -y \, dy$ and $dy = n \, dn,$ so
\[\int dn = \int -y \, dy\]and
\[\int dy = \int n \, dn.\]These give us
\[n = -\frac{y^2}{2}\]and $y = \frac{n^2}{2}.$  Then $2n = -y^2$ and $2y = n^2,$ so
\[y^2 + 2n = 0\]and $n^2 - 2y = 0.$  Hence, $y^2 + 2n = n^2 - 2y,$ so
\[x^2 - y^2 - 2x - 2y = 0.\]This factors as $x^2 - 2x - (y^2 + 2y) = 0 = f.$

Therefore, $\nabla f = 2n - 2 - (2y + 2) = 2x - 2y - 4.$  At the origin, $\nabla f = -4.$  Therefore, at the origin, it is a source.
