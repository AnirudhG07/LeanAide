## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=-y \) and \( \dot{y}=x). Prove that the origin is circulation.


## Proof: **(c)** We are given the system of differential equations:

$$\dot{x} = -y, \quad \dot{y} = x.$$

We can rewrite this system in matrix form as:

$$\begin{pmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \end{pmatrix} = A \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}.$$

Therefore, the matrix $A$ is given by

$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$

We can calculate the trace and determinant of $A$ as follows:

$$\text{Tr}(A) = 0 + 0 = 0,$$
$$\text{Det}(A) = (0)(0) - (-1)(1) = 1.$$

The eigenvalues of $A$ are the roots of the characteristic equation:
$$\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0.$$

This gives us:
$$\begin{vmatrix} -\lambda & -1 \\ 1 & -\lambda \end{vmatrix} = \lambda^2 + 1 = 0.$$

Solving for $\lambda$, we get:

$$\lambda = \pm i.$$

Hence, according to the trace-determinant phase plane analysis, since $\text{Tr}(A) = 0$ and $\text{Det}(A) = 1 > 0$, this is an example of a **center**, which means the system exhibits **circulation**.
