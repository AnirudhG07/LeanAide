## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=-y \) and \( \dot{y}=x). Prove that the origin is circulation.


## Proof: Take $y=r\sin{\theta t}$, $r \in (0, \infty)$ $t \in [-\pi, \pi]$ 
$x = r\cos{\theta t}$
$\dot{x} = -r\sin{t} = -y$
$\dot{y} = r\cos{t} = x$
The phase portrait for this is 

Hence, Origin is a Circulation
