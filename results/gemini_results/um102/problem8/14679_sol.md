## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=-y \) and \( \dot{y}=x). Prove that the origin is circulation.


## Proof: Take $y = r\sin{\theta t}$, $r \in (0,\infty)$, $\theta t \in [-\pi, \pi]$, $x= r\cos{\theta t}$. 

$\dot{x} = -r\sin{\theta t} = -y$
$\dot{y} = r\cos{\theta t} = x$

The phase portrait for this is a circulation around the origin. Hence, the origin is a circulation.
