## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=-y \) and \( \dot{y}=x). Prove that the origin is circulation.


## Proof: (c) We are given the system of differential equations $\dot{x} = -y$ and $\dot{y} = 2x$.  We can write this in matrix form as 
\[\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{x}.\]The determinant of the matrix is $\Delta = 1$, and the trace of the matrix is 0, so the eigenvalues are $i$ and $-i$.  Since the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, the system describes a **circulation**.
