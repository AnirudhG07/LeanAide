To proceed, we need to determine the eigenvalues of the matrix \\(A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) and analyze the behavior of the system based on these eigenvalues.  Specifically, we need to show that the eigenvalues are purely imaginary, indicating a center at the origin and thus circulation."

For instance, the reduction of matrix \\(A\\), the derivation of \\(A_{v_{1}}\\), and the calculations involving \\(Av_{1}\\) and \\(Av_{2}\\) need to be clarified and completed for the proof to be meaningful."
