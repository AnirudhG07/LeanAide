## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=y \) and \( \dot{y}=-x-y). Prove that the origin is circulation.


## Proof: d) $\dot x = y$
$\dot y = -x-y$

$\implies \ddot x = -x-y$
$\implies \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = - (\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{dy}{dt})$ $\implies$ It's a saddle, circulation.
