        "Statement": "Since the real part of the eigenvalues is negative, the origin is a spiral sink.",
        "Error": "While a negative real part of the eigenvalues implies convergence to the origin, it does not guarantee a spiral behavior. The presence of the imaginary part only indicates oscillation, which could result in either a spiral or a center. Further analysis, like examining the eigenvectors or phase portrait, is needed to confirm the spiral nature."
