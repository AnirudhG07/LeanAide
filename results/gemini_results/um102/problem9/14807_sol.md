## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=y \) and \( \dot{y}=-x-y). Prove that the origin is circulation.


## Proof: **(d)** We need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\ -1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$. To do this, we solve the characteristic equation: 

 $$|A - \lambda I| = 0 \implies \begin{vmatrix} -\lambda & 1 \\\ -1 & -1-\lambda \end{vmatrix} = 0.$$

 Expanding the determinant, we get 
 
 $$\lambda (\lambda + 1) + 1 = 0.$$

 This simplifies to $\lambda^2 + \lambda + 1 = 0$.  Solving this quadratic equation, we obtain  $$\lambda = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{3}i}{2}.$$ 

 Here, $\text{Re}(\lambda) = -\frac{1}{2}$. Since the real part of the eigenvalue is negative, the system spirals towards the origin as $t \to \infty$. Therefore, the origin is a **spiral sink**.
