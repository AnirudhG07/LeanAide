## Theorem: For the linear differential equation \( \dot{x}=y \) and \( \dot{y}=-x-y). Prove that the origin is circulation.


## Proof: **(d)** We have the system of differential equations given by $\dot{x} = y$ and $\dot{y} = -x - y$.  This can be written in matrix form as 
\[\begin{pmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \end{pmatrix} = A \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}.\]Then $\text{Tr}(A) = -1$ and $\text{Det}(A) = 1$.  Since $[\text{Tr}(A)]^2 < 4 \text{Det}(A)$ and $\text{Tr}(A) < 0$, the origin is a spiral sink.
