## Theorem: Prove that the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) on the ellipsoid \( x^{2}+2 y^{2}+3 z^{2}=1 \) have the largest distance from the origin. You may assume that any continuous function on the ellipsoid attains its maximum.

**3.** Eqn. of ellipsoid : $x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 1$
Now we have to maximise the function  $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ in order to find point for maximum distance.

$f = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$

From the constraint,

$f = \sqrt{1 - 2y^2 - 3z^2 + y^2 + z^2}$

     $= \sqrt{1-y^2 - 2z^2}$

Now, for f to be a maximum,

$\nabla f = 0$

$\implies \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\hat{j} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\hat{k} = 0$

$\implies \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1-y^2 - 2z^2}} (-2y) \hat{j} + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1-y^2 - 2z^2}} (-4z)\hat{k} = 0$

$\implies y = 0$ & $z = 0$  for extremum.

By putting this in constraint equation,

$x^2 = 1$

$\implies x = \pm 1$

Hence the extremum points are $(1, 0, 0)$ & $(-1, 0, 0)$, i.e. either minimum or maximum on the ellipsoid.

We've to show that they are maxima.

If we can find a point on ellipsoid whose distance is less than that of  $(1, 0, 0)$ or $(-1, 0, 0)$, then these points are maxima.

Let, a point on ellipsoid is $(0, \frac{1}{\sqrt2}, 0)$.

Distance = $\sqrt{0 + \frac{1}{2} + 0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt2}$

Distance of $(1, 0, 0)$ & $(-1, 0, 0)$ from origin $= 1$.

Hence points $(1, 0, 0)$ & $(-1, 0, 0)$ have the largest distance from origin.

## Cleaned Mathematical Proof:

**Problem:** Find the points on the ellipsoid $x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 1$ farthest from the origin.

**Solution:** To find the points farthest from the origin, we need to maximize the function $f = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$, which represents the distance of a point $(x,y,z)$ from the origin, subject to the constraint that the point lies on the ellipsoid.

Using the constraint $x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 1$, we can rewrite the function $f$ as:

$f = \sqrt{1 - 2y^2 - 3z^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \sqrt{1-y^2 - 2z^2}$.

For $f$ to be maximum, its gradient must be zero:

$\nabla f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\hat{j} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\hat{k} = 0$.

This gives us:

$\frac{1}{2\sqrt{1-y^2 - 2z^2}} (-2y) \hat{j} + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1-y^2 - 2z^2}} (-4z)\hat{k} = 0$.

Solving this, we get $y=0$ and $z=0$ as the conditions for extremum.

Substituting these values back into the equation of the ellipsoid gives us $x^2=1$, implying $x = \pm 1$.

Therefore, the extremum points are $(1,0,0)$ and $(-1,0,0)$. These points can be either minimum or maximum points on the ellipsoid.

To confirm that these are indeed maximum points, we need to show that there exists at least one point on the ellipsoid whose distance from the origin is smaller than that of $(1,0,0)$ and $(-1,0,0)$.

Consider the point $(0, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0)$ which lies on the ellipsoid. Its distance from the origin is: 

Distance $= \sqrt{0 + \frac{1}{2} + 0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

The distance of $(1,0,0)$ and $(-1,0,0)$ from the origin is $1$. Since $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} < 1$, we can conclude that the points $(1,0,0)$ and $(-1,0,0)$ are indeed the points on the ellipsoid farthest from the origin.
