## Theorem: Prove that the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) on the ellipsoid \( x^{2}+2 y^{2}+3 z^{2}=1 \) have the largest distance from the origin. You may assume that any continuous function on the ellipsoid attains its maximum.

**3. Eqn. of ellipsoid:  $x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 1$**

**Now we have to maximise the function $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ in order to find point for maximum distance.**

**$f = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$**

**From the constraint,**

**$f = \sqrt{1-2y^2 - 3z^2 + y^2 + z^2}$**

**$= \sqrt{1-y^2 - 2z^2}$**

**Now for $f$ to be a maximum,**

**$\nabla f = 0$**

**$\Rightarrow \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \hat{j} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \hat{k} = 0$**

**$\Rightarrow \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1-y^2-2z^2}} (-2y)\hat{j} + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1-y^2-2z^2}}(-4z) \hat{k} = 0$**

**$\Rightarrow y = 0$ & $z = 0$  for extremum.**

**By putting this in constraint equation,**

**$x^2 = 1$**

**$\Rightarrow x = \pm 1$**

**Hence the extremum points are $(1, 0, 0)$  & $(-1, 0, 0)$, i.e. either minimum or maximum on the ellipsoid.**

**We've to show that they are maxima.**

**If we can find a point on ellipsoid whose distance is less than that of $(1,0,0)$ or $(-1,0,0)$ then these points are maxima.**

**Let, a point on ellipsoid is  $(0,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},0)$.**

**Distance $= \sqrt{0+\frac{1}{2}+0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$**

**Distance of $(1,0,0)$ & $(-1,0,0)$ from origin**

**$= 1$**

**Hence points $(1,0,0)$ & $(-1,0,0)$ have the largest distance from origin.**



## Cleaned Mathematical Proof:

We are given the equation of an ellipsoid: $x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 1$. To find the point on this ellipsoid that is furthest from the origin, we need to maximize the function representing the distance from a point to the origin, which is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$. Let's denote this function as  $f$, so $f = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.

Using the constraint provided by the ellipsoid equation, we can rewrite the function $f$ as  $f = \sqrt{1-y^2 - 2z^2}$.

To find the maximum of $f$, we set its gradient equal to zero: $\nabla f = 0$. This gives us the following equation: $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \hat{j} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \hat{k} = 0$. 

Calculating the partial derivatives and setting them equal to zero leads us to the following equation: $\frac{1}{2\sqrt{1-y^2-2z^2}} (-2y)\hat{j} + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{1-y^2-2z^2}}(-4z) \hat{k} = 0$.  

Solving this equation, we find that $y = 0$ and $z = 0$ are the potential locations for the extremum of the function. 

Substituting these values back into the ellipsoid equation, we get $x^2 = 1$, which yields two possible solutions: $x = 1$ and  $x = -1$. 

Therefore, we have two potential extremum points: $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(-1, 0, 0)$. These points could represent either a minimum or a maximum distance from the origin.

To determine whether these points are maxima, we need to find a point on the ellipsoid whose distance from the origin is less than the distance of  $(1,0,0)$ and  $(-1,0,0)$ from the origin.

Consider the point $(0,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},0)$, which lies on the ellipsoid.  The distance of this point from the origin is $\sqrt{0+\frac{1}{2}+0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

The distance of both $(1,0,0)$ and $(-1,0,0)$ from the origin is $1$. Since  $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} < 1$, we can conclude that the points $(1,0,0)$ and $(-1,0,0)$ are indeed the points on the ellipsoid furthest from the origin.
