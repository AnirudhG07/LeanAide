## Theorem: Prove that the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) on the ellipsoid \( x^{2}+2 y^{2}+3 z^{2}=1 \) have the largest distance from the origin. You may assume that any continuous function on the ellipsoid attains its maximum.


## Proof: **Text with LaTeX:**

3. Eqn. of ellipsoid: $x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 1$. 

Now we have to maximise the function $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ in order to find point for maximum distance.

$f = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.

From the constraint, 

$f = \sqrt{1 - 2y^2 - 3z^2 + y^2 + z^2}$
$ = \sqrt{1 - y^2 - 2z^2}$.

Now, for $f$ to be a maximum,
$\nabla f = 0$

$\implies \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y} \hat{j} + \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial z} \hat{k} = 0$

$\implies \dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{1-y^2 - 2z^2}}(-2y)\hat{j} + \dfrac{1}{2\sqrt{1-y^2 - 2z^2}}(-4z)\hat{k} = 0$

$\implies y = 0$ & $z = 0$  for extremum.

By putting this in constraint equation, 
$x^2 = 1$
$\implies x = \pm 1$.

Hence, the extremum points are (1, 0, 0) & (-1, 0, 0), i.e. either minimum or maximum on the ellipsoid.

We've to show that they are maxima. 

If we can find a point on ellipsoid whose distance is less than that of (1, 0, 0) or (-1, 0, 0) then these points are maxima.

Let, a point on ellipsoid is $(0, \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0)$.

Distance $ = \sqrt{0 + \dfrac{1}{2} + 0} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Distance of (1, 0, 0) & (-1, 0, 0) from origin $=1$.

Hence, points (1, 0, 0) & (-1, 0, 0) have the largest distance from origin. 


**Clean Mathematical Proof:**

**Problem:** Find the points on the ellipsoid $x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 1$ that are furthest from the origin.

**Solution:**

To find the points on the ellipsoid furthest from the origin, we need to maximize the distance from a point (x, y, z) on the ellipsoid to the origin. This distance is given by  $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.

Let $f(x, y, z) =  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.  We want to maximize *f* subject to the constraint $x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 1$.

Using the constraint, we can rewrite *f* as a function of two variables:

$f(y, z) = \sqrt{1 - 2y^2 - 3z^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2 - 2z^2}$

To find the critical points of *f*, we set its gradient equal to zero:

$\nabla f = \left( \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}, \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right) = \left( \dfrac{-y}{\sqrt{1-y^2 - 2z^2}}, \dfrac{-2z}{\sqrt{1-y^2 - 2z^2}}  \right) = (0, 0)$

This gives us  *y* = 0 and *z* = 0. Substituting these values into the constraint equation, we get *x* = ±1. Thus, the critical points are (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0).

To confirm that these points correspond to maximum distances, we can consider another point on the ellipsoid, for example, (0, 1/√2, 0). The distance of this point from the origin is 1/√2, which is less than the distance of (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) from the origin (which is 1). 

Therefore, the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) are the points on the ellipsoid that are furthest from the origin.
