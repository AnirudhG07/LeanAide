## Theorem: Prove that the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) on the ellipsoid \( x^{2}+2 y^{2}+3 z^{2}=1 \) have the largest distance from the origin. You may assume that any continuous function on the ellipsoid attains its maximum.

3. Eqn. of ellipsoid : $x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 1$

Now we have to maximise the function $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ in order to find point for maximum distance. 

$f = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$

From the constraint,

$f = \sqrt{1 - 2y^2 - 3z^2 + y^2 + z^2}$
$ = \sqrt{1 - y^2 - 2z^2}$

Now for $f$ to be a maximum,
$\nabla f = 0$

$\implies \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \hat{j} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \hat{k} = 0$

$\implies \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{1 - y^2 - 2z^2}} (-2y) \hat{j} + \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{1 - y^2 - 2z^2}} (-4z) \hat{k} = 0$

$\implies y = 0$  & $z = 0$ for extremum.

By putting this in constraint equation,

$x^2 = 1$

$\implies x = \pm 1$

Hence the extremum points are $(1, 0, 0)$ & $(-1, 0, 0)$, i.e. either minimum or maximum on the ellipsoid.

We've to show that they are maxima.

If we can find a point on ellipsoid whose distance is less than that of $(1, 0, 0)$ or $(-1, 0, 0)$ then these points are maxima.

Let, a point on ellipsoid is $(0, 1/ \sqrt{2}, 0)$.

Distance $ = \sqrt{0 + 1/2 + 0} = 1/ \sqrt{2}$

Distance of $(1, 0, 0)$ & $(-1, 0, 0)$ from origin $= 1$.

Hence points $(1, 0, 0)$ & $(-1, 0, 0)$ have the largest distance from origin. 


## Cleaned Mathematical Proof:

The equation of the ellipsoid is $x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 1$. To find the point on the ellipsoid furthest from the origin, we must maximize the distance function, which is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$. Let $f = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$. From the constraint, we can rewrite $f$ as $f = \sqrt{1 - 2y^2 - 3z^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2 - 2z^2}$. For $f$ to be a maximum, its gradient,  $\nabla f$, must be equal to zero. This implies $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \hat{j} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \hat{k} = 0$, which expands to $\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{1 - y^2 - 2z^2}} (-2y) \hat{j} + \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{1 - y^2 - 2z^2}} (-4z) \hat{k} = 0$. This gives us $y = 0$  and $z = 0$ for the extremum. Substituting these values into the constraint equation gives $x^2 = 1$, therefore $x = \pm 1$. This means the extremum points are $(1, 0, 0)$ and  $(-1, 0, 0)$. These points could represent either a minimum or maximum distance on the ellipsoid.  

To determine whether these points represent maxima, we need to find a point on the ellipsoid with a smaller distance than  $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(-1, 0, 0)$. Consider the point $(0, 1/ \sqrt{2}, 0)$, which lies on the ellipsoid. Its distance from the origin is $ \sqrt{0 + 1/2 + 0} = 1/ \sqrt{2}$.  The distance of  $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(-1, 0, 0)$ from the origin is 1, which is larger than $1/ \sqrt{2}$. Therefore,  the points $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(-1, 0, 0)$ have the largest distance from the origin.
