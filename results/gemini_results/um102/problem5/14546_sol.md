## Theorem: Prove that the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) on the ellipsoid \( x^{2}+2 y^{2}+3 z^{2}=1 \) have the largest distance from the origin. You may assume that any continuous function on the ellipsoid attains its maximum.


## Proof: $$
x^2+2x^3+3x^5\leq n \\
\Rightarrow \frac{x^2}{5} + \frac{1-x^2}{5}  + \frac{x^2+x^3}{5} + \frac{x^3+x^5}{5} + \frac{2x^4+x^5}{5} \leq n \\
x \in [0,1] \\
x^2 \in [0,\frac{1}{2}] \\
x^3 \in [0,1] \\
x^5 \in [0,\frac{1}{2}] \\
x^2+2x^3 +3x^5 \leq n \\
\forall x \quad \leq 2.9 \\
\Rightarrow 2(x^2+2x^3+3x^5) \leq 2(2) \leq (-(x^4) +4y^3+6z^5)(2) 
$$
Let's clean up the provided mathematical expressions and embed them within a coherent explanation:

The problem begins with the inequality: 
 $$x^2 + 2x^3 + 3x^5 \leq n$$

The expression on the left-hand side is then manipulated to become:
$$\frac{x^2}{5} + \frac{1-x^2}{5}  + \frac{x^2+x^3}{5} + \frac{x^3+x^5}{5} + \frac{2x^4+x^5}{5} \leq n$$

Several ranges for  $x$ and its powers are then stated:

*  $x \in [0,1]$ 
* $x^2 \in [0,\frac{1}{2}]$ 
* $x^3 \in [0,1]$ 
* $x^5 \in [0,\frac{1}{2}]$

The initial inequality is restated:

$$x^2 + 2x^3 + 3x^5 \leq n$$

Followed by an assertion about its maximum value:
$$\forall x  \quad  \leq 2.9$$

Finally, a new inequality is presented:

$$2(x^2 + 2x^3 + 3x^5) \leq 2(2) \leq (-(x^4) + 4y^3 + 6z^5)(2)$$
