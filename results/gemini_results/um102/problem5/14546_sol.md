## Theorem: Prove that the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) on the ellipsoid \( x^{2}+2 y^{2}+3 z^{2}=1 \) have the largest distance from the origin. You may assume that any continuous function on the ellipsoid attains its maximum.


## Proof: Unfortunately, the provided image contains a lot of scribbles and diagrams that are difficult to interpret even for a human, let alone an AI. It's not possible to extract a coherent mathematical proof from this. 

To get a proper LaTeX transcription and a potential proof, please provide:

1. **A clearer image:** Ensure the image is well-lit and not blurry. 
2. **A step-by-step breakdown:** If possible, break down the solution into individual steps, each with its own image or clear description.

With better input, I'll be able to assist you in generating a LaTeX transcription and potentially understand the underlying proof.
