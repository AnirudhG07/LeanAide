## Theorem: Prove that the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) on the ellipsoid \( x^{2}+2 y^{2}+3 z^{2}=1 \) have the largest distance from the origin. You may assume that any continuous function on the ellipsoid attains its maximum.


## Proof: Our constraint is $x^2 = 1$, $x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 1$ 
and we have to maximise the distance $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$

i.e. we can also maximise $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = f$.

Since both these functions are infinitely differentiable, we can use Lagrange multipliers.
$\nabla f = (2x_1, 2y, 2z)$
$\nabla g = (2x_1, 4y, 6z)$

If it is a maximum point
$\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$
$(2x_1, 2y, 2z) = (2\lambda x_1, 4\lambda y, 6\lambda z)$

Possible solutions are
$1) \lambda = 1 \implies (x, 0, 0) = (\pm 1, 0, 0) \implies r^2 = 1$ Since the point must satisfy g.
$2) \lambda = \frac{1}{2} \implies (0, y, 0) = (0, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0) \implies r^2 = \frac{1}{2}$
$3) \lambda = \frac{1}{3} \implies (0, 0, z) = (0, 0, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) \implies r^2 = \frac{1}{3}$

Hence we see that the max value of $r^2 = 1$

$ \implies $ max distance from the origin is 1

and the points are $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$ 

## Clean Proof

Our constraint is $x^2 = 1$ and $x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 1$, and we need to maximize the distance $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$. 

This is equivalent to maximizing $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, which we will denote as function $f$. Since both $f$ and the constraint functions are infinitely differentiable, we can use Lagrange multipliers.

The gradients are $\nabla f = (2x, 2y, 2z)$ and $\nabla g = (2x, 4y, 6z)$.  At a maximum point, we have the condition $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$, which gives us $(2x, 2y, 2z) = (2\lambda x, 4\lambda y, 6\lambda z)$.

We then consider the possible solutions:
1. If $\lambda = 1$, then we have $(x, 0, 0) = (\pm 1, 0, 0)$, which implies $r^2 = 1$. We need to verify if these points satisfy the constraint equation g. 
2. If $\lambda = \frac{1}{2}$, then $(0, y, 0) = (0, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0)$, resulting in $r^2 = \frac{1}{2}$.
3. If $\lambda = \frac{1}{3}$, then $(0, 0, z) = (0, 0, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})$, leading to $r^2 = \frac{1}{3}$.

From these possibilities, we observe that the maximum value of $r^2$ is 1. Consequently, the maximum distance from the origin is 1, and the corresponding points are $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$.
