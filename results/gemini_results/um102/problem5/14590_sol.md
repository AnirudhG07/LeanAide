## Theorem: Prove that the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) on the ellipsoid \( x^{2}+2 y^{2}+3 z^{2}=1 \) have the largest distance from the origin. You may assume that any continuous function on the ellipsoid attains its maximum.


## Proof: Our constraint is $x^2 = 1$, $x^2 + 2y^2 +3z^2 = 1$
and we have to maximise the distance $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$
i.e we can also maximise $r^2$ instead of $r$ since $r$ is always +ve and if $r^2$ is maximum automatically.
i.e. we can maximise $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = f$.
Since both these functions are infinitely differentiable, we can use Lagrange multipliers.
$\nabla f = (2x_1, 2y, 2z)$, $\nabla g = (2x_1, 4y, 6z)$
if it is a maximum point
$\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$ $(2x_1, 2y, 2z) = (2\lambda x_1, 4\lambda y, 6\lambda z)$
possible solutions are:
1. $\lambda = 1  \implies (x, 0, 0) = (\pm 1, 0, 0)$ $\implies r^2 = 1$ since the point must satisfy $g$.
2. $\lambda = \frac{1}{2} \implies (0, y, 0) = (0, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0)$ $\implies r^2 = \frac{1}{2}$
3. $\lambda = \frac{1}{3} \implies (0, 0, z) = (0, 0, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})$ $\implies r^2 = \frac{1}{3}$
Hence we see that the max value of $r^2 = 1$
$\implies$ max distance from the origin is 1 
and the points are $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$

Our constraint is $x^2=1$, $x^2+2y^2+3z^2=1$. We have to maximize the distance $\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$. 

We can also maximize $r^2$ instead of $r$ since $r$ is always positive and if $r^2$ is maximized, $r$ is automatically maximized. That is, we can maximize $x^2+y^2+z^2 = f$.

Since both of these functions are infinitely differentiable, we can use Lagrange multipliers. We have that $\nabla f = (2x, 2y, 2z)$ and $\nabla g=(2x, 4y, 6z)$. If $(x, y, z)$ is a maximum point, then $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$, which gives us $(2x, 2y, 2z) = (2\lambda x, 4\lambda y, 6\lambda z)$. The possible solutions to this system of equations are:

1. $\lambda=1$, which implies $(x, 0, 0) = (\pm 1, 0, 0)$ and so $r^2=1$ since the point must satisfy $g$.
2.  $\lambda = \frac{1}{2}$, which implies $(0, y, 0) = (0, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0)$ and so $r^2 = \frac{1}{2}$.
3.  $\lambda = \frac{1}{3}$, which implies $(0, 0, z) = (0, 0, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})$ and so $r^2 = \frac{1}{3}$.

Hence we see that the maximum value of $r^2$ is $1$. This implies that the maximum distance from the origin is $1$ and the points at which this distance is achieved are $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$.
