## Theorem: Prove that the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) on the ellipsoid \( x^{2}+2 y^{2}+3 z^{2}=1 \) have the largest distance from the origin. You may assume that any continuous function on the ellipsoid attains its maximum.


## Proof: Our constraint is $x^2 = n^2y^2 + z^2 = 1$ and we have to maximise the distance.  i.e. we can also maximise $r^2$ instead of $r$ since $r$ is always +ve and if $r^2$ is maximum, automatically $r$ is maximum. 
i.e. we can maximise $n^2 y^2 + z^2 = f$. Since both these functions are infinitely differentiable, we can use Lagrange multipliers. $\nabla f = (2n^2y, 2z)$, $\nabla g = (2n, 4y, 6z)$.
If it is a maximum point $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$. $(2n^2 y, 2z) = (2\lambda n, 4\lambda y, 6 \lambda z)$.
Possible solutions are
1)  $\lambda = 1 \implies (n,0,0) = (\pm 1, 0, 0)$ Since the point must satisfy $g$.
2) $\lambda = 2 \implies (0, y, 0) = (0, \pm \sqrt{1/2}, 0),  r^2 = 1/2$
3) $\lambda = 3 \implies (0,0,z) = (0,0, \pm 1/3), r^2 = 1/9$
Hence we see that the max value of $r^2 = 1$
$\implies$ max distance from the origin is $1$ 
and the points are $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$

**Rewritten Proof:**

**Problem:** Find the maximum distance from the origin to the surface defined by the constraint  $x^2 = n^2y^2 + z^2 = 1$.

**Solution:**

Instead of maximizing the distance $r$, we can maximize $r^2 = n^2y^2 + z^2$, since $r$ is always positive and $r^2$ is maximized whenever $r$ is maximized. 

Let $f(y,z) = n^2y^2 + z^2$. We want to maximize $f$ subject to the constraint $g(x,y,z) = x^2 - n^2y^2 - z^2 + 1 = 0$.

Since both $f$ and $g$ are infinitely differentiable, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.  We seek points where the gradients of $f$ and $g$ are parallel:

$$ \nabla f = \lambda \nabla g,$$

where $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier.  Computing the gradients, we have

$$\nabla f = (2n^2y, 2z), \quad \nabla g = (2n, -4n^2y, -2z).$$

Therefore, we need to solve the system of equations

\begin{align*}
2n^2y &= 2\lambda n, \\
2z &= -4\lambda n^2 y, \\
0 &= -2\lambda z.
\end{align*}

From the third equation, we have either $\lambda = 0$ or $z=0$.  If $\lambda = 0$, then the first two equations imply $y=z=0$, which contradicts the constraint $g=0$.  Therefore, we must have $z=0$.

Substituting $z=0$ into the first two equations, we obtain 

\begin{align*}
n^2y &= \lambda n, \\
0 &= -4\lambda n^2 y. 
\end{align*}

If $y=0$, then the first equation implies $\lambda = 0$, which we have already ruled out. Therefore, we must have $n^2 = \lambda$.  Substituting into the constraint equation $g=0$ with $z=0$, we obtain $x^2 = 1$, so $x = \pm 1$.

Thus, the possible solutions are $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$.  These points satisfy the constraint $g=0$, and at each of these points we have $r^2 = 1$.

Therefore, the maximum value of $r^2$ is 1, which implies that the maximum distance from the origin to the surface is 1. The points on the surface that are farthest from the origin are $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$.
