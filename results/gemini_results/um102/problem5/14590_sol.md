## Theorem: Prove that the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) on the ellipsoid \( x^{2}+2 y^{2}+3 z^{2}=1 \) have the largest distance from the origin. You may assume that any continuous function on the ellipsoid attains its maximum.


## Proof: Our constraint is $x^2 = 1$, $n^2 + 2y + 3z^2 = 1$
and we have to maximise the distance $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ i.e. we can also maximise $r^2$ instead of $r$ since $r$ is always +ve and if $r^2$ is maximum automatically $r$ is maximum.
i.e. we can maximise $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = f$.
Since both these functions are infinitely differentiable we can use Lagrange multipliers.
$\nabla f = (2x_1, 2y, 2z)$, $\nabla g = (2x_1, 4y, 6z)$.

If it is a maximum point
$\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$
$(2x_1, 2y, 2z) = \lambda (2x_1, 4y, 6z)$

possible solutions are:
(1) $\lambda = 1  \implies (x,0,0) = (\pm 1, 0, 0) \implies r^2 = 1$ (since the point must satisfy $g$)
(2) $\lambda = 2 \implies (0, y, 0) = (0, \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}, 0) \implies r^2 = \frac{1}{2}$
(3) $\lambda = 3 \implies (0, 0, z) = (0, 0, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) \implies r^2 = \frac{1}{3}$ 

Hence, we see that the max value of $r^2=1$
$\implies$ max distance from the origin is 1
and the points are $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$

**Cleaned-up Proof:**

Our constraint is given by the equations  $x^2 = 1$ and $n^2 + 2y + 3z^2 = 1$.  Our goal is to maximize the distance $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$. We observe that it is equivalent to maximize $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$,  since $r$ is always positive and $r^2$ reaching its maximum implies that $r$ itself is maximized.

Since the functions involved are infinitely differentiable, we can employ the method of Lagrange multipliers.  Let  $f = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ and let $g$ represent the constraint equations. We compute the gradients: $\nabla f = (2x, 2y, 2z)$ and $\nabla g = (2x, 4y, 6z)$. 

At a maximum point, the gradients must satisfy the relationship $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$ for some scalar $\lambda$. This gives us the equation $(2x, 2y, 2z) = \lambda (2x, 4y, 6z)$.  We proceed to explore possible solutions for $\lambda$ and the corresponding points $(x,y,z)$ while ensuring these points satisfy the constraint $g$.
