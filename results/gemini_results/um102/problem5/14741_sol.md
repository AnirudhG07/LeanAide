## Theorem: Prove that the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) on the ellipsoid \( x^{2}+2 y^{2}+3 z^{2}=1 \) have the largest distance from the origin. You may assume that any continuous function on the ellipsoid attains its maximum.


## Proof: 3. Consider the functions
 $g: R^3 \rightarrow R$ s.t. $g(x,y,z)= x^2+2y^2+3z^2$
 & $f: R^3 \rightarrow R$  s.t. $f(x,y,z)= x^2 + y^2 + z^2$

Note that given $(x,y,z)$, $f$ returns square of the point's distance $d$ from origin.

Maximising $d$ is the same as maximising $d^2$ ($: d \ge 0$)

The problem is to maximise $f$ under the constraint $g(x,y,z)=1$

We know that, at the restricted extremum of $f$, it $\nabla g =0$, $\nabla g, \nabla f$ are $\parallel$ (as $\nabla g \neq 0$ [Lagrange multipliers])

The gradients are given by
$\nabla g = (\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial g}{\partial z})$
$=> \nabla g (x,y,z) = (2x, 4y, 6z)$
& $\nabla f=(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial z})$
$=> \nabla f(x,y,z) = (2x, 2y, 2z)$
$=> (2x,4y,6z) = \lambda (2x,2y,2z)$

We will consider the 3 possible cases:
case ①: $\lambda = 1$ & $y=z=0$ 
substituting $y=z=0$ in $g(x,y,z)=1$, we get $x^2=1$ ($x=1$ or $x=-1$)
substituting $x = 1$ & $y=z=0$ in $f(x,y,z)$ we get $f(1,0,0) = 1 + (1,0,0) = 1$

case ②: $\lambda = 2$ & $x=z=0$ 
substituting $x=z=0$ in $g(x,y,z)=1$, 
we get $2y^2=1$  $=> y^2= \frac{1}{2}$ ($y = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$) 
Substituting $y^2 = \frac{1}{2}$ & $x=z=0$ in $f(x,y,z)$, 
$f(0, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0) = 1- (0, \frac{1}{2}, 0) = \frac{1}{2}$

case ③: $\lambda = 3$ & $x=y=0$ 
substituting $x=y=0$ in $g(x,y,z)=1$, 
we get $3z^2=1$ $=> z^2= \frac{1}{3}$ ($z= \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$)
substituting $z^2= \frac{1}{3}$ & $x=y=0$ in $f(x,y,z)$, 
$f(0,0,\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) = f(0,0,\frac{1}{3}) = \frac{1}{3}$ 

$f$ is maximum in case ③ 

the points $(1,0,0)$ & $(-1,0,0)$ have largest distance from Origin, given by $d^2=1$


## Cleaned up Mathematical Proof

**Problem:** Maximize the function $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ subject to the constraint $g(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 1$.

**Solution:**

We note that for a given point $(x,y,z)$, the function $f$ returns the square of the point's distance $d$ from the origin.  Therefore, maximizing $d$ is equivalent to maximizing $d^2$, since $d \ge 0$.

To find the maximum of $f$ under the constraint $g(x,y,z) = 1$, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers. This method states that at a restricted extremum of $f$, the gradients of $f$ and $g$ are parallel, provided that the gradient of $g$ is nonzero.

The gradients of $f$ and $g$ are given by:

$$\nabla g = \left( \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial g}{\partial z} \right) = (2x, 4y, 6z)$$

$$\nabla f = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right) = (2x, 2y, 2z)$$

Setting the gradients proportional, we have:

$$(2x, 4y, 6z) = \lambda (2x, 2y, 2z)$$

where $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier.

We now consider the three possible cases:

**Case 1:** $\lambda = 1$ and $y = z = 0$

Substituting $y = z = 0$ into the constraint equation $g(x,y,z) = 1$, we get $x^2 = 1$. This gives us two possible points: $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(-1, 0, 0)$.  Evaluating $f$ at $(1, 0, 0)$, we get $f(1, 0, 0) = 1$.

**Case 2:** $\lambda = 2$ and $x = z = 0$

Substituting $x = z = 0$ into the constraint equation $g(x,y,z) = 1$, we get $2y^2 = 1$, which gives us $y^2 = \frac{1}{2}$.  This yields two possible points: $\left( 0, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0 \right)$ and $\left( 0, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0 \right)$.  Evaluating $f$ at both points, we get $f\left( 0, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0 \right) = \frac{1}{2}$.

**Case 3:** $\lambda = 3$ and $x = y = 0$

Substituting $x = y = 0$ into the constraint equation $g(x,y,z) = 1$, we get $3z^2 = 1$, which gives us $z^2 = \frac{1}{3}$.  This yields two possible points: $\left( 0, 0, \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)$ and $\left( 0, 0, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)$.  Evaluating $f$ at both points, we get $f\left( 0, 0, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}$.

Comparing the values of $f$ at all the candidate points, we see that the maximum value of $f$ is 1, which occurs at the points $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(-1, 0, 0)$. Therefore, the points $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(-1, 0, 0)$ are farthest from the origin, with a distance of $d = \sqrt{f(1, 0, 0)} = \sqrt{f(-1, 0, 0)} = 1$.
