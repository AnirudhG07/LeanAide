## Theorem: Prove that the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) on the ellipsoid \( x^{2}+2 y^{2}+3 z^{2}=1 \) have the largest distance from the origin. You may assume that any continuous function on the ellipsoid attains its maximum.


## Proof: $f(x,y,z)=x^2+2y^2+3z^2-1$

Take a spherical function,
$g(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2+z^2-r^2$

When $f$ is in the same direction as $g$.

$\nabla f$ is in the same direction as $\nabla g$.

We can write

$\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$

$\implies (2x\hat{i}+4y\hat{j}+6z\hat{k})=\lambda(2x\hat{i}+2y\hat{j}+2z\hat{k})$

On equating individual components we have these cases.
$\text{i})\implies \lambda = 1$
$x=y=0$

$\text{ii})\implies \lambda = 2$
$y=z=0$

$\text{iii})\implies \lambda = 3$
$x, y = 0$

$\text{Case i)}$ Here, $x = \pm 1$, $y = z = 0$
Distance from the origin $r = 1$

$\text{Case ii)}$ Here, $y=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $x, z = 0$
$r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$

$\text{Case iii)}$ Here, $z=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, $y, x = 0$
$r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$


Clearly, $\text{Case i)}$ has the point on the ellipsoid with largest distance from the origin. 

These are $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$.


## Cleaned-up Mathematical Proof:

Let $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 - 1$ and consider the spherical function $g(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - r^2$.  When $\nabla f$ is in the same direction as $\nabla g$, we can write $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$. 

This implies $(2x\hat{i} + 4y\hat{j} + 6z\hat{k}) = \lambda (2x\hat{i} + 2y\hat{j} + 2z\hat{k})$.  Equating individual components, we have three cases:

**(i)** If $\lambda = 1$, then $x = y = 0$.

**(ii)** If $\lambda = 2$, then $y = z = 0$.

**(iii)** If $\lambda = 3$, then $x = y = 0$.

In Case (i), $x = \pm 1$ and $y=z=0$, so the distance from the origin is $r=1$. 

In Case (ii), $y = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $x=z=0$, so $r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

In Case (iii), $z= \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ and $x=y=0$, so $r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.

Clearly, Case (i) has the point on the ellipsoid with the largest distance from the origin. These points are $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$.
