## Theorem: Prove that the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) on the ellipsoid \( x^{2}+2 y^{2}+3 z^{2}=1 \) have the largest distance from the origin. You may assume that any continuous function on the ellipsoid attains its maximum.


## Proof: $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 - 1$

Take a spherical function, 
$g(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - r^2$

When, $f(x,y,z)$ attains maxima or minima, $\nabla f$ is in the same direction as $\nabla g$. 

$\therefore$ We can write 
$\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$
$\implies (2x \hat{i} + 4y\hat{j} + 6z\hat{k} ) = \lambda (2x \hat{i} + 2y \hat{j} + 2z \hat{k})$ 
On equating individual components, we have these cases.
$(i) \implies 2 = 2\lambda \implies \lambda = 1 \implies x, y, z = 0$

$(ii) 4 = 2\lambda \implies \lambda = 2 \implies x, z = 0$

$(iii) 6 = 2\lambda \implies \lambda = 3 \implies x, y = 0$

Case $(i)$ Here, $\lambda = 1$, $x,y,z = 0$ Distance from the origin, $r = 1$

Case $(ii)$ Here, $y = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $x, z = 0$ $\because r^2 = \frac{1}{2}$ $r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$

Case $(iii)$ Here, $z = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, $y,x = 0$ $r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ 

Clearly, Case $(i)$ has the point on the ellipsoid with largest distance from the origin.

These are $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$ & $(-1, 0, 0)$.

Let $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 - 1$. Take a spherical function $g(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - r^2$. When $f(x,y,z)$ attains maxima or minima, $\nabla f$ is in the same direction as $\nabla g$. Therefore, we can write $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$. This implies that $(2x \hat{i} + 4y\hat{j} + 6z\hat{k} ) = \lambda (2x \hat{i} + 2y \hat{j} + 2z \hat{k})$. On equating individual components, we have three cases.

**Case (i)** We have $2=2\lambda$, which implies that $\lambda=1$, and $x=y=z=0$. Thus, the distance from the origin is $r=1$.

**Case (ii)** We have $4=2\lambda$, which implies that $\lambda=2$, and $x=z=0$. Thus, $y=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Because $r^2=\frac{1}{2}$, the distance from the origin is $r=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

**Case (iii)** We have $6=2\lambda$, which implies that $\lambda=3$, and $x=y=0$. Thus, $z=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, and the distance from the origin is $r=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.

Clearly, Case $(i)$ has the point on the ellipsoid with largest distance from the origin. These points are $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$ and $(-1, 0, 0)$.
