## Theorem: Prove that the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) on the ellipsoid \( x^{2}+2 y^{2}+3 z^{2}=1 \) have the largest distance from the origin. You may assume that any continuous function on the ellipsoid attains its maximum.


## Proof: $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 - 1$

Take a spherical function, 
$g(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - r^2$

When $f(x,y,z)$ attains maxima or minima, $\nabla f$ is in the same direction as $\nabla g$.

We can write 
$\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$
$\implies (2x \hat{i} + 4y \hat{j} + 6z \hat{k}) = \lambda (2x \hat{i} + 2y \hat{j} + 2z \hat{k})$

On equating individual components, we have these cases:
$(i) \implies 2 = \lambda$
      $\lambda = 2 \implies x = 1$
      $y, z = 0$
$(ii) 4 = \lambda$
       $\lambda = 2 \implies y = 1$
       $x, z = 0$
$(iii) 6 = \lambda$
        $\lambda = 2 \implies z = 1$
        $x, y = 0$

Case $(i)$ Here, $x = \pm 1$, $y, z = 0$
Distance from the origin: $x = 1$

Case $(ii)$ Here, $y = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $x, z = 0$
                     $x = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}}$
                     $x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$

Case $(iii)$ Here, $z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, $y, x = 0$

Clearly, Case $(i)$ has the point on the ellipsoid with largest distance from the origin.

These are $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$.

Let $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 - 1$. Let $g(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - r^2$ be a spherical function. 

When $f(x,y,z)$ attains maxima or minima, $\nabla f$ is in the same direction as $\nabla g$. We can write $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$. This implies $(2x \hat{i} + 4y \hat{j} + 6z \hat{k}) = \lambda (2x \hat{i} + 2y \hat{j} + 2z \hat{k})$.

On equating individual components, we have these cases:

* $(i)$ If $2 = \lambda$, then $\lambda = 2$ implies $x = 1$ and $y = z = 0$.

* $(ii)$ If $4 = \lambda$, then $\lambda = 2$ implies $y = 1$ and $x = z = 0$. 

* $(iii)$ If $6 = \lambda$, then $\lambda = 2$ implies $z = 1$ and $x = y = 0$.

In Case $(i)$, $x = \pm 1$ and $y = z = 0$. Thus, the distance from the origin is $x = 1$.

In Case $(ii)$, $y = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $x = z = 0$. Therefore, $x = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

In Case $(iii)$, $z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ and $x = y = 0$.

Clearly, Case $(i)$ has the point on the ellipsoid with the largest distance from the origin. These points are $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$.
