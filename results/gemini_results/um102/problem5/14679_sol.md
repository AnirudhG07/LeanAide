## Theorem: Prove that the points (1, 0, 0) and (-1, 0, 0) on the ellipsoid \( x^{2}+2 y^{2}+3 z^{2}=1 \) have the largest distance from the origin. You may assume that any continuous function on the ellipsoid attains its maximum.


## Proof: $f(x, y, z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 -1$

Take a spherical function, 
$g(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - r^2$

When $f$ is in the same direction as $g$,
$\nabla f$ is in the same direction as $\nabla g$.

$\therefore$ We can write
$\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$
$\Rightarrow (2x \hat{i} + 4y\hat{j} + 6z\hat{k}) = \lambda (2x \hat{i} + 2y\hat{j} + 2z\hat{k})$

On equating individual components, we have these cases:
**(i)**  $2 = 2\lambda \Rightarrow \lambda = 1$ 
$4 = 2\lambda \Rightarrow y = 0$
$\therefore y, z = 0$

**(ii)** $4 = 2\lambda \Rightarrow \lambda = 2$
$2 = 2\lambda \Rightarrow x = 0$
$\therefore x, z = 0$

**(iii)** $6 = 2\lambda \Rightarrow \lambda = 3$
$2 = 2\lambda \Rightarrow z = 0$
$\therefore x, y = 0$

**Case (i)** Here, $x = \pm 1$, $y = z = 0$
Distance from the origin: $x = \pm 1$

**Case (ii)** Here, $y = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $x, z = 0$
$\therefore x = \sqrt{1-\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$

**Case (iii)** Here, $z = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, $y, x = 0$
$\therefore x = \sqrt{1-\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$

Clearly, **Case (i)** has the point on the ellipsoid with largest distance from the origin.

These are $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$ 


**Rewritten proof:**

We aim to find the points on the ellipsoid $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 - 1 = 0$ that are furthest from the origin.  We will use the method of Lagrange multipliers, noting that maximizing the distance is equivalent to maximizing the square of the distance.

Consider the squared distance function $g(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. At a maximum point on the ellipsoid, the gradient of $f$ and the gradient of $g$ are parallel.  Therefore, there exists a scalar $\lambda$ such that $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$. 

Computing the gradients, we have 
\[\nabla f = (2x, 4y, 6z)\] 
and 
\[\nabla g = (2x, 2y, 2z).\]
Setting $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$ gives us the system of equations
\begin{align*}
2x &= \lambda 2x, \\
4y &= \lambda 2y, \\
6z &= \lambda 2z.
\end{align*}
We consider the solutions to this system in three cases.

**Case 1:** $\lambda = 1$.  Then $y = z = 0$, and substituting into the equation $f(x,y,z) = 0$, we get $x = \pm 1$.  This gives us the points $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$.

**Case 2:** $\lambda = 2$. Then $x = z = 0$, and substituting into the equation $f(x,y,z) = 0$, we get $y = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. This gives us the points $\left( 0, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0 \right)$.

**Case 3:** $\lambda = 3$.  Then $x = y = 0$, and substituting into the equation $f(x,y,z) = 0$, we get $z = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. This gives us the points $\left( 0, 0, \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)$.

Of these points, the points $(\pm 1, 0, 0)$ are furthest from the origin, so these are the points on the ellipsoid $f(x,y,z) = 0$ that maximize the distance from the origin.
