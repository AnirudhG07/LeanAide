## Theorem: Let \( f(x, y)=x^{3}-3 x+y^{2} \) for \( x, y \in \mathbb{R} \). Prove that at the points (1,0) and (-1,0) the gradient of \( f \) is zero.


## Proof: We have that $\nabla f(x,y) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \hat{i} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \hat{j} =(3x-2)\hat{i} + 2y \hat{j}$.  To find where $\nabla f = 0$, we solve the system $3x-2=0$ and $2y=0$.  This gives us $x = \frac{2}{3}$ and $y=0$. Thus, $\nabla f = 0$ at $(\frac{2}{3},0)$.
