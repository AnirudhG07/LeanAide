## Theorem: Let \( f(x, y)=x^{3}-3 x+y^{2} \) for \( x, y \in \mathbb{R} \). Prove that at the points (1,0) and (-1,0) the gradient of \( f \) is zero.


## Proof: As we know that, the gradient of $f$ is given by 
$$\nabla f(x,y) = \bigg(\frac{\delta f}{\delta x}, \frac{\delta f}{\delta y}\bigg).$$
$$\therefore \nabla f(x,y) = (3x^2 - 3, 2y)$$

To find the points where $\nabla f(x,y) = 0$
$$(3x^2 - 3, 2y) = (0,0)$$
$$\implies 2y = 0 \implies y = 0$$
and 
$$3x^2 - 3 = 0 \implies x = 1 \text{ or } x = -1$$

$\therefore$ The points where the gradient of $f$ is zero are $(1, 0)$ & $(-1, 0)$.
