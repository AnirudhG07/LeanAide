## Theorem: Let \( f(x, y)=x^{3}-3 x+y^{2} \) for \( x, y \in \mathbb{R} \). Prove that at the points (1,0) and (-1,0) the gradient of \( f \) is zero.


## Proof: We know that the gradient of $f$ is given by
$\nabla f(x,y) = (\frac{\partial f}{\partial x},\frac{\partial f}{\partial y})$.

$\nabla f(x,y) = (3x^2-3, 2y)$

To find the points where $\nabla f(x,y) = 0$
$(3x^2-3, 2y)=(0,0)$
$ \implies 2y=0 \implies y = 0$
& 
$3x^2-3 = 0 \implies x = 1$ or $x = -1$

The points where the gradient of $f$ is zero are
$(1,0)$ & $(-1,0)$.
