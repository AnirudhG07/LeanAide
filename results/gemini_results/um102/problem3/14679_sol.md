## Theorem: Let \( f(x, y)=x^{3}-3 x+y^{2} \) for \( x, y \in \mathbb{R} \). Prove that at the points (1,0) and (-1,0) the gradient of \( f \) is zero.


## Proof: Let $f(x, y) = x^3 - 3x + y^2$. The gradient of $f$ is 
$$\nabla f(x, y) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \hat{i} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \hat{j} \right) = \left( (3x^2-3)\hat{i} + 2y \hat{j} \right).$$
Setting the gradient equal to zero, we have
$$(3x^2 - 3) \hat{i} + 2y \hat{j} = 0.$$ 
Thus, $3x^2 - 3 = 0$ and $2y = 0$, which implies $x = \pm 1$ and $y=0$. Therefore, the points $(x, y)$ are $(1, 0)$ and $(-1, 0)$.  Note that $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ are the standard basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$.
