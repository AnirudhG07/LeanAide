## Theorem: Let \( \mathscr{S} \) denote the vector space over \( \mathbb{R} \) of all real sequences (with usual addition and scalar multiplication of sequences). Then prove that the set
\[
W=\left\{\left\{x*{n}\right\}*{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathscr{S}:\left\{x*{n}^{2}\right\}*{n \in \mathbb{N}} \text { is convergent }\right\}
\]
is not a subspace of \( \mathscr{S} \).


## Proof: $W\subseteq S$, and $S$ is a vector space, to confirm the V.S nature of $W$, allow need to do is prove 3 things.

(a) Presence of $O$ vector in $W$.

$\implies \vec{0}$new is indeed present in $W!

as,  $l^2\vec{0}$new $= \vec{0}$ new, which is convergent?

(b) {two modes

$l^2\vec{y_n}$ new $\in W$,

this means that 

$l^2\vec{y_n}$new is cugt.

Now, conversely...

let $\vec{x_n}$new $\in W$, now $\because$ is a scalar, $\in \mathbb{R}$,

$\implies l^2\vec{x_n}$ does indeed belong to $W$, as, 

 $C$ is a constant, and sin $\vec{x_n}$new $\in$ 

$l^2\vec{x_n}$ is cugt, we have that $l(l^2\vec{x_n}$new is also cugt.

$\{l^2\vec{x_n}$ new $\in W\}$

(c) Now consider a cugt. sequence. $\{l^2\vec{x_n}\}$new. 

It is a product of 2 sequences: $x_n$ and $y_n$.

$cug t. \times cug t. = cug t.$ we must have $x_n$, $y_n$ both being 

$cug t./ \{x_n\}$ being cugt. and $\{y_n\}$ being divg.

let us consider the latter case, i.e.
(contradiction)

$\{x_n\}$ is indeed cugt, whilst $\{y_n\}$ is uncontrolled.

right away, as $\{x_n\}$, $\{y_n\}$ and $\{x_n*\frac{y_n}{x_n}\}$ is the SAME 

sequence, and cannot have different properties

$\because \{l^2\vec{x_n}\}$ is cugt, then $\{\vec{y_n}\}$new is ALSO cugt.

Now, $\because l^2\vec{y_n}$new belong to $W$, they are both cugt. sequences.

$\implies \{x_n*y_n\}$new MUST be cugt. 
cugt. * cugt. = cugt.

$ \{x_n\}=\{y_n\}=\{1,\frac{-1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{-1}{4}\}$

$\frac{y_n}{x_n} \rightarrow 1$

$|\frac{y_n+1}{x_n+1}|\leq \epsilon$

$|(y_n+1)-(x_n+1)|<\epsilon$

as (cugt $\times$ cugt =cugt.)

$\because$ $x_n*y_n \in W$

$W$ is a vectorsub space of $S$. $\{l^2y_n\}$new ...

---

We need to prove three things to confirm that $W$ is a vector subspace of the vector space $S$, given that $W$ is a subset of $S$:

a) The zero vector is in $W$.  

We can show that the zero vector is in $W$ because $l^2$ times the zero vector is equal to the zero vector, which is convergent.

b) If $l^2 y_n$ is an element of $W$, then $l(l^2 y_n)$ is also an element of $W$. 

We know that if $l^2y_n$ is an element of $W$, then  $l^2y_n$  is convergent.  

Conversely, let $x_n$ be an element of $W$. Since $l$ is a real scalar, then $l^2x_n$ is also an element of $W$. Because $C$ is a constant and $x_n$ is an element of $l^2 x_n$, $l^2 x_n$ is convergent. Therefore, $l (l^2x_n)$ is also convergent. Thus, if $l^2x_n$ is an element of $W$, then the set of all elements of the form $l^2x_n$ is also an element of $W$.

c) If $l^2x_n$ is a convergent sequence, then $x_n * y_n$ must also be a convergent sequence.

Consider a convergent sequence of the form $l^2x_n$.  This sequence is the product of two sequences: $x_n$ and $y_n$. We know that the product of two convergent sequences is also a convergent sequence, so we must have that both $x_n$ and $y_n$ are convergent, or that $x_n$ is convergent and $y_n$ is divergent.  

Consider the case where $x_n$ is convergent and $y_n$ is divergent. In this case, since the sequences  $x_n$, $y_n$, and $x_n * \frac{y_n}{x_n}$ are the same sequence, and a sequence cannot be both convergent and divergent, we know that $y_n$ must also be convergent.

Now, since $l^2y_n$ is an element of $W$ and is convergent, $x_n * y_n$ must also be convergent because the product of two convergent sequences is also convergent. 

Therefore, since $x_n * y_n$ is an element of $W$, $W$ is a vector subspace of $S$.
