## Theorem: Let \( \mathscr{S} \) denote the vector space over \( \mathbb{R} \) of all real sequences (with usual addition and scalar multiplication of sequences). Then prove that the set
\[
W=\left\{\left\{x*{n}\right\}*{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathscr{S}:\left\{x*{n}^{2}\right\}*{n \in \mathbb{N}} \text { is convergent }\right\}
\]
is not a subspace of \( \mathscr{S} \).


## Proof: There is no mathematical text in this image.
