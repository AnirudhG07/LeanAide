## Theorem: Let \( \mathscr{S} \) denote the vector space over \( \mathbb{R} \) of all real sequences (with usual addition and scalar multiplication of sequences). Then prove that the set
\[
W=\left\{\left\{x*{n}\right\}*{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathscr{S}:\left\{x*{n}^{2}\right\}*{n \in \mathbb{N}} \text { is convergent }\right\}
\]
is not a subspace of \( \mathscr{S} \).


## Proof: Let $u, w \in W$ such that $v = \{v_n\}$, $w = \{w_n\}$.

Then $\sum v_n^2$ and $\sum w_n^2$ are convergent $\implies \sum v_n^2 + w_n^2$ is convergent and $\sum v_n w_n$ are convergent. 

Now, $v + w = \sum v_n + w_n = (v_1, w_1), (v_2 + w_2), \dots$. $\sum (v_n + w_n)^2 = \sum v_n^2 + w_n^2 + 2 v_n w_n^2$. 

As we cannot say anything about the convergence of $\sum v_n w_n^2$, we cannot say anything about the convergence of $\sum v_n^2 + w_n^2 + 2 v_n w_n^2 = \sum (v_n + w_n)^2$.

Hence, we cannot say whether $v+w \in W$ $\forall$ $v, w \in W$.

$\implies W$ is not a subspace of $S$.
