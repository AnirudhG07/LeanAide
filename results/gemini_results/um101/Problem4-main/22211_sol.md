## Theorem: Let \( \mathscr{S} \) denote the vector space over \( \mathbb{R} \) of all real sequences (with usual addition and scalar multiplication of sequences). Then prove that the set
\[
W=\left\{\left\{x*{n}\right\}*{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathscr{S}:\left\{x*{n}^{2}\right\}*{n \in \mathbb{N}} \text { is convergent }\right\}
\]
is not a subspace of \( \mathscr{S} \).


## Proof: ## Extracted Text with LaTeX:

**Counterexample/violation of axiom 2 of Subspaces:**

$A = \{ a_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} = \{ \frac{a}{n} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$  i.e  $a_n = \frac{1}{n}$  $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$ 

$B = \{ b_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$

Now $A \in W$ as $A^2 = \{ \frac{1}{n^2} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is convergent (to 1)

$B \in W$ as $B^2 = \{ \frac{1}{(2n)^2} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} = \{ \frac{1}{4n^2} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is convergent (to 1)

But $A + B = \{ \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{(2n)^2} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} = \{ c_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$

$c_n = 2$ when n is even

$c_n = 0$ when n is odd

.  $(A+B)^2 = \{ 4, 0, 4, 0, ... \}$

As $(A+B)^2$ is not convergent $\Rightarrow (A+B) \notin W$

. . W is not a subspace.

**Proof of *:**

$(A+B)^2 = \{ d_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} + 2 \{ \frac{1}{n(2n)^2} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$  where $d_n = 2 + \frac{1}{n \in \mathbb{N}}$

. . $\{ \frac{1}{n(2n)} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} = \{(A+B)^2 - \{ d_n \}\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$

- if $(A+B)^2$ was convergent, by algebra of convergence of sequences we would get  $\{ \frac{1}{n(2n)} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ as convergent which is false

. . $(A+B)^2$ is also not convergent. 


## Cleaned-up Mathematical Proof:

Let $A = \{ a_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ where  $a_n = \frac{1}{n}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and let $B = \{ b_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$.

We see that $A \in W$ because $A^2 = \{ \frac{1}{n^2} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to 1. 

Similarly, $B \in W$ because $B^2 = \{ \frac{1}{(2n)^2} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} = \{ \frac{1}{4n^2} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to 1.

However, $A + B = \{ \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{(2n)^2} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} = \{ c_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, where $c_n = 2$ when n is even and $c_n = 0$ when n is odd.

Therefore, $(A+B)^2 = \{ 4, 0, 4, 0, ... \}$. Since $(A+B)^2$ does not converge, this implies that $(A+B) \notin W$.

Therefore, W is not a subspace.

**Proof of *:**

We can write $(A+B)^2 = \{ d_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} + 2 \{ \frac{1}{n(2n)^2} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, where $d_n = 2 + \frac{1}{n}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

This implies that $\{ \frac{1}{n(2n)} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} = \{(A+B)^2 - \{ d_n \}\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$.

If $(A+B)^2$ were convergent, then by the algebra of convergent sequences, we would have that  $\{ \frac{1}{n(2n)} \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is convergent, which is false.

Therefore, $(A+B)^2$ is also not convergent.
