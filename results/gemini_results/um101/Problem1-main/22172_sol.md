## Theorem: Let \( A, B \subset \mathbb{R} \) be nonempty sets that are bounded above. Then prove that \( A \cup B \) is nonempty and bounded above, and
\[
\sup (A \cup B)=\max \{\sup A, \sup B\}
\]


## Proof: Page 2/22:
$A \not= \Phi$, $B \not= \Phi$.
We have that $A$ and $B$ are bounded above. TRUE/FALSE
Proof:
$\forall x \in E \implies x \le P$
$\implies a \le P$  $\forall a \in A$
and $b \le P$ $\forall b \in B$.

Since $A \not= \Phi$ and $b \not= \Phi$, $A \cup B = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in A$ or $x \in B \}$. 
Let $x \in A \cup B$. Then $x \in A$ or $x \in B$.
$\implies x \le P$ or $x \le P$
$\implies x \le P = \max \{P, P\}$ or $x \le P = \max \{P, P\}$
$\implies x \le \max \{P, P\}$

Since $x$ was arbitrary, $A \cup B$ is bounded above. 
Since $A \cup B$ is non-empty, by $l.u.b$ principle, $z = \sup (A \cup B)$ exists
$\implies z = \max \{p, q\}$, $z = \sup (A \cup B)$ is upper bound. 
suppose $z < \max \{p, q\}$.
$\implies z < P$ & $z < Q$.
WLOG, say $P < Q$. Then a supremum of $B$, $z$ cannot be an upper bound of $B$.

To prove $k$ is the supremum of $A \cup B$:
Suppose not, then $\exists l < k$ s.t $l = \sup (A \cup B)$
Let us WLOG, (without loss of generality) we assume that $m < n$. 
$\implies k = \max \{m, n\} = n \implies l < n$

As $l$ is the supremum of $A \cup B$,
$\implies x \le l$ $\forall$ $x \in A \cup B$

As $n = \sup B$, $\exists$ $b \in B$ s.t $l < b \le n$ (As $l < n$)
As $n = \sup A \cup B$ (by definition)
but $b \le l < b_0$ where $b_0 \in A \cup B$
$\implies l < b_0$.

This is a contradiction, as $l = \sup (A \cup B)$

Hence, we can say that $\sup (A\cup B) = k = \max \{\sup A, \sup B\}$



Corrected Text:

$A \neq \Phi$, $B \neq \Phi$.  We have that $A$ and $B$ are bounded above. TRUE/FALSE

**Proof:**

$\forall x \in E \implies x \leq P$
$\implies a \leq P$  $\forall a \in A$ and $b \leq P$ $\forall b \in B$.

Since $A \neq \Phi$ and $B \neq \Phi$, $A \cup B = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \}$. 
Let $x \in A \cup B$. Then $x \in A$ or $x \in B$.
$\implies x \leq P$ or $x \leq P$
$\implies x \leq P = \max \{P, P\}$ or $x \leq P = \max \{P, P\}$
$\implies x \leq \max \{P, P\}$

Since $x$ was arbitrary, $A \cup B$ is bounded above. 
Since $A \cup B$ is non-empty, by the l.u.b. principle, $z = \sup (A \cup B)$ exists.
This implies $z = \max \{p, q\}$ and $z = \sup (A \cup B)$ is an upper bound. 

Suppose $z < \max \{p, q\}$.
This implies $z < P$ and $z < Q$.
Without loss of generality, assume $P < Q$. Then, as $z$ is a supremum of $B$, $z$ cannot be an upper bound of $B$. 

---
To prove $k$ is the supremum of $A \cup B$:
Suppose not; then $\exists l < k$ such that $l = \sup (A \cup B)$.
Without loss of generality, assume that $m < n$. 
This implies $k = \max \{m, n\} = n$, which implies $l < n$.

As $l$ is the supremum of $A \cup B$,
we have that $x \leq l$  $\forall$  $x \in A \cup B$.

As $n = \sup B$, there exists $b \in B$ such that $l < b \leq n$ (as $l < n$).
As $n = \sup A \cup B$ (by definition),
we have $b \leq l < b_0$ where $b_0 \in A \cup B$. This implies $l < b_0$.

This is a contradiction, as $l = \sup (A \cup B)$.

Hence, we can say that $\sup (A\cup B) = k = \max \{\sup A, \sup B\}$.
