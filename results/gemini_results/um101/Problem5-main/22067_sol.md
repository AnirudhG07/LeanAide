## Theorem: Give a proof by first principles of:
the function \( f(x)=x^{1 / 3} \) is continuous at \( x=1 \).
Note. You must give a direct \( \epsilon-\delta \) proof. You cannot quote any theorems such as the inverse function theorem, the mean value theorem, etc.


## Proof: **Page 1**

Proof: Let us consider: $f(x)=x^{1/3}$.

Now, to prove continuity, at $x = 1$, we must show that $\exists \ \delta > 0$, $\delta \in \mathbb{R}$, $\forall$ when $\epsilon >0$, $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$

$|x-1|<\delta$,

$0<|x^{1/3}-1|<\epsilon$, for some fixed $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$.

wkt, $x^{1/3}$ is defined at $x^{1/3}$, and $f(x) = x^{1/3}$.

Now, to prove $\lim_{x \to 1}f(x)$ exists, we can take $x \to 1$, and following $\delta, \epsilon$

Now, by the defn of limit, $(\forall \epsilon>0, \ \epsilon \in \mathbb{R}, \ \exists \ \delta > 0, \delta \in \mathbb{R})$ , when $|x-1|<\delta$, $\delta$ is constant.

Let us take $x = 1$. 

Now, $|x-1|<\delta$.

wkt, $|x| = x$,
$|x^{1/3}-1|<\delta$

$0<|x^{1/3}-1|<\epsilon$,  $\delta \to \epsilon$, as $x \to 1$.

Now, $|x^{1/3} + 1|$

**Page 3**

For the case of $x\geq 1$, and $x<1$,
$x<x^{1/3}$,
$x^{1/3}-1>x-1$. 
However,
as $x<1$,
$x^{1/3}<1$,
$x^{1/3}-1<0$,
$|x^{1/3}-1| = -(x^{1/3}-1)$.
$|x+1| = -(x+1)$
$|x-1| \leq |x^{1/3}-1|$.
since, $\delta > |x-1| > 0$,
$\delta > |x^{1/3}-1| \geq 0$.
$\epsilon > |x^{1/3}-1| \geq 0$

For both $x\geq 1$, and $x<1$, we get that,
i.e. when $|x-1|<\delta$,
then $|x^{1/3}-1| \leq \epsilon$

So, we have that $\lim_{x \to 1} x^{1/3} = 1$

**Page 4**

As, we on comparing with the defn, we get $l=1$.

$\lim_{x\to 1} x^{1/3} = 1 = f(x)$

$x^{1/3}$ is cts. at $1$.

**Cleaned-up proof:**

**Proof:**  Let us consider the function $f(x) = x^{1/3}$. To prove continuity at $x=1$, we must show that for every $\epsilon > 0$, $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists a $\delta > 0$, $\delta \in \mathbb{R}$, such that when  $|x - 1| < \delta$, then $0 < |x^{1/3} - 1| < \epsilon$.

We know that $x^{1/3}$ is defined at $x = 1$ and $f(1) = 1$. To prove that $\lim_{x \to 1} f(x)$ exists, we can consider $x$ approaching $1$ and use the definition of a limit. 

By the definition of a limit, for every $\epsilon > 0$, $\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists a $\delta > 0$, $\delta \in \mathbb{R}$, such that when $|x - 1| < \delta$, $\delta$ is constant. Let us take $x = 1$. 

Now, we have $|x - 1| < \delta$.  Since $|x| = x$, we can write $|x^{1/3} - 1| < \delta$. This implies that $0 < |x^{1/3} - 1| < \epsilon$. Since $\delta$ approaches $\epsilon$ as $x$ approaches $1$, we have $\delta \to \epsilon$ as $x \to 1$.

Now, let's consider the expression $|x^{1/3} + 1|$. 

For the case when $x \ge 1$ and $x < 1$, we have $x < x^{1/3}$ and $x^{1/3} - 1 > x - 1$. However, since $x < 1$, it follows that $x^{1/3} < 1$. Therefore, we have $x^{1/3} - 1 < 0$. 

This implies that $|x^{1/3} - 1| = -(x^{1/3} - 1)$ and $|x + 1| = -(x + 1)$. Consequently, we obtain $|x - 1| \le |x^{1/3} - 1|$.

Since $\delta > |x - 1| > 0$, we can conclude that $\delta > |x^{1/3} - 1| \ge 0$. It follows that $\epsilon > |x^{1/3} - 1| \ge 0$.

For both cases when $x \ge 1$ and $x < 1$, we find that when $|x - 1| < \delta$, then $|x^{1/3} - 1| \le \epsilon$.

Therefore, we have shown that $\lim_{x \to 1} x^{1/3} = 1$.

Comparing this result with the definition of a limit, we see that $l = 1$. Hence, we have $\lim_{x \to 1} x^{1/3} = 1 = f(1)$.

Therefore, we can conclude that $x^{1/3}$ is continuous at $x = 1$.
