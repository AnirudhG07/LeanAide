## Theorem: Prove that the series \( \sum\_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\sin \frac{1}{n}\right)^{3 / 2} \) is convergent.


## Proof: As $0 \leq \frac{1}{n} \leq 1$ $\forall$ $n \geq 1$, 
$$\sin(0) \leq \frac{1}{n} \leq \sin(1).$$
$0 = \sin(0) \leq \sin(\frac{1}{n}) \leq \sin(1)$ $\forall$ $n \geq 1$ (sin is an increasing function). 
$$0 \leq (\sin(\frac{1}{n}))^{3/2} \leq (\sin(1))^{3/2}$$
$\forall$ $n \geq 1$.

As $\sin(x)$ is continuous, by the sequential character of continuity, as $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0$
$$\implies \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sin(\frac{1}{n}) = \sin(0) = 0$$
By the same principle,  $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (\sin(\frac{1}{n}))^{3/2} = 0^{3/2} = 0$$ 
($\because$ $n^{3/2}$ is continuous).
