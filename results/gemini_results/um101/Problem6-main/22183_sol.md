## Theorem: Prove that the series \( \sum\_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\sin \frac{1}{n}\right)^{3 / 2} \) is convergent.


## Proof: **(a) Convergent.**

$\lim_{n \to \infty} Y_n = 0$

$\lim_{n \to \infty} sin Y_n = 0$

$\sum (sin Y_n)^{3/2}$ is convergent

$0 < Y_n \leq 1 < \frac{\pi}{2}$

$0 < sin(Y_n) < 1$

as in the given range

$sin$ is monotonic & bold

... convergent

**Mathematical Proof:**

We are given that $\lim_{n \to \infty} Y_n = 0$.  We also know that $0 < Y_n \leq 1 < \frac{\pi}{2}$. 

It follows that $0 < sin(Y_n) < 1$, as the sine function is bounded between 0 and 1 in the given range. 

Additionally, the sine function is monotonic and bounded in this range.

Therefore, ...
