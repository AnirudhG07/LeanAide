## Theorem: Let \( f:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) be a positive continuous function. Let \( M \) denote the maximum value of \( f \), i.e., \( M=\max \{f(x): x \in[0,1]\} \). Assuming that the limit
\[
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(\int_{0}^{1} f(x)^{n} d x\right)^{1 / n}
\]
exists, show that it is equal to \( M \). Hint. Show that the above limit is bounded above and below by \( M \). The bound from above is easier.
