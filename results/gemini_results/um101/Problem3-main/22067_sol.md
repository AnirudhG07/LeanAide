## Theorem: Let \( f:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) be a Riemann integrable function. Then, prove that the function \( F:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) given by
\[
F(x)=\int\_{0}^{x} f(t) d t
\]
is not differentiable at each \( x \in(0,1) \).


## Proof: **Counterexample:**
Let $f(x) = \begin{cases} x, & x \neq 1/4 \\ 1, & x = 1/4. \end{cases}$.

Here, $f(x)$ is in $\mathbb{R}$ over all $[0,1]$, as it exists at all but 1 point.

So, 
$F(x) = \int\limits_{0}^{x} f(t) \, dt = \frac{x^2}{2}$.

However, by I FTOC, there is not a guarantee that $F(x)$ is definitely differentiable at $f(\frac{1}{4})$, as $f(x)$ is not continuous at that point.

Here, $F(x) = \frac{x^2}{2}$. 
Let us assume $F(x)$ is differentiable at all $x \in (0,1)$.

$\therefore$ $F'(x) = \frac{2x}{2} = \boxed{x}$ (from FTOC).

However, from our $f(x)$, we have $f(\frac{1}{4}) = 1$, but from II FTOC, we have $f(\frac{1}{4}) = \frac{1}{4}$.

This is a contradiction. $\therefore$ Our assumption was wrong. $\therefore$, $F(x)$ is not differentiable $\forall \, x  \in (0,1)$.
