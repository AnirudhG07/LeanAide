## Theorem: Let \( f:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) be a Riemann integrable function. Then, prove that the function \( F:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) given by
\[
F(x)=\int\_{0}^{x} f(t) d t
\]
is not differentiable at each \( x \in(0,1) \).


## Proof: Given $f:[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ is Riemann integrable, I also have 
$F'(t) = f(t)$.

As $f$ is continuous over the interval $[0,1]$, so, $F'(t)$ can be assumed to be continuous over the same interval and hence $F$ can be said to be differentiable over the interval $(0,1)$.
