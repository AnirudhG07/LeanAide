## Theorem: Let \( f, g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) be differentiable functions such that

- \( f(0)=g(0) \),
- \( f^{\prime}(x) \leq g^{\prime}(x) \) for all \( x \geq 0 \).

Show that \( f(x) < q(x) \) for all \( x \geq 0 \).


## Proof: Given: 
$f(0) = g(0)$ 
$f'(x) \leq g'(x)$. 

Want: 
$f(x) \leq g(x)$. 

Proof: 
$f(x), g(x)$ are differentiable. This means that $f'(x), g'(x)$ exist $\forall \ x \in \mathbb{R}$. 

We can now say that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are primitives of $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ respectively.

Since $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ exist, $\forall \ x \in \mathbb{R}$, we know, from I FTOC, that $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are continuous of all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. This is sufficient for Riemann Integrability over a closed interval. 

So, from our above mentioned, 
$f(x)-f(0) = \int\limits_{0}^{x} f'(t) dt = \int\limits_{0}^{x} f'(t) dt$ (from given that $f(0) = 0$. II FTOC)

and, 
$g(x)-g(0) = [\int\limits_{0}^{x} g'(t) dt = g(x)]$ (similarly)

$\therefore \ \forall \ x, \ \forall \ x >0, \ x \in \mathbb{R}$, 

$f'(t) \leq g'(t)$, [given]. 

we get that 
$\int\limits_{0}^{x} f'(t) \leq \int\limits_{0}^{x} g'(t)$. [from our result proved previously]. 

$\implies f(x) \leq g(x)$. 
Hence proved. 


**Cleaned-up Proof:**

Given that $f(0) = g(0)$ and $f'(x) \leq g'(x)$, we want to show that $f(x) \leq g(x)$.

**Proof:**

Since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are differentiable, their derivatives $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ exist for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.  Consequently, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are primitives of $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, respectively.

The existence of $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ implies, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (I FTOC), that  $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are continuous for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. This continuity ensures Riemann integrability over any closed interval. 

Therefore, applying the second part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (II FTOC) and using the fact that $f(0)=0$, we have:

 $$f(x)-f(0) = \int\limits_{0}^{x} f'(t) dt = \int\limits_{0}^{x} f'(t) dt.$$

Similarly, 
$$g(x)-g(0) = \int\limits_{0}^{x} g'(t) dt = g(x).$$

Now, for all $x > 0$ in $\mathbb{R}$, we are given that $f'(t) \leq g'(t)$.  Integrating both sides of this inequality from $0$ to $x$, and using a previously proven result regarding the preservation of inequalities under integration, we obtain:

$$\int\limits_{0}^{x} f'(t) dt \leq \int\limits_{0}^{x} g'(t) dt.$$

This implies $f(x) \leq g(x)$, completing the proof.
