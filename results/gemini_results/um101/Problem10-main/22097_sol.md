## Theorem: Let \( V \) be a vector space over \( \mathbb{R} \). Suppose \( T: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is a linear transformation such that the null space of \( T \) is finite-dimensional. Show that \( V \) is finite dimensional. Hint. Recall that the dimension of \( \mathbb{R} \) as a vector space over \( \mathbb{R} \) is 1 .
