## Theorem: Let \( V \) be a vector space over \( \mathbb{R} \). Suppose \( T: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is a linear transformation such that the null space of \( T \) is finite-dimensional. Show that \( V \) is finite dimensional. Hint. Recall that the dimension of \( \mathbb{R} \) as a vector space over \( \mathbb{R} \) is 1 .


## Proof: **Extracted Text:**

Proof:

Thus, $\text{dim (null } T)$ is finite, (you can show that $\text{Rank} (T)$ is finite, by Rank - Nullity Theorem, we are done. (...this thm is applicable for fid.v.s. only)

$T:V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

This implies that,  $\text{if } T(v) = w, [w \in \mathbb{R}]$, $\exists \text{ a vector space } W,  \ni W = \{w : T(v) = w, w \in \mathbb{R} \}$.

Now, $W \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

$\mathbb{R}$ has a basis of $\{1\}$, $ \text{i.e.,}  \{1\} \text{ is whole}$

member of the $\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. $\rightarrow  \# \text{basis} (W)  \leq  \# \text{basis} (\mathbb{R})$.

$\implies \text{dim}(W) \leq \text{dim}(\mathbb{R})$

$ | 0 < \text{dim}(w) \leq 1 | $.

... $\text{dim}(w) = 1  \text{ or }  0$.

... $\text{dim }W$ is finite.

... $\text{Rank}(T)$ is finite.

... $\text{dim}(V)$ is finite. (from Rank - nullity theorem).

Hence proved.

**Cleaned-Up Proof:**

Proof:

Thus, $\text{dim(null }T)$ is finite. You can show that $\text{Rank}(T)$ is finite by the Rank-Nullity Theorem. 

Consider the linear transformation $T:V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. This implies that if $T(v) = w$, where $w \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists a vector space $W$ such that $W = \{w : T(v) = w, w \in \mathbb{R}\}$.

Now, $W \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. The real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ has a basis of $\{1\}$. Therefore, the number of basis vectors in $W$ is less than or equal to the number of basis vectors in $\mathbb{R}$: $\# \text{basis}(W)  \leq  \# \text{basis}(\mathbb{R})$. 

This implies $\text{dim}(W) \leq \text{dim}(\mathbb{R})$, so $ 0 < \text{dim}(W) \leq 1$. Consequently, $\text{dim}(W) = 1$ or $0$, and $\text{dim}(W)$ is finite.

Because $\text{dim}(W)$ is finite, $\text{Rank}(T)$ is finite. Therefore, by the Rank-Nullity Theorem, $\text{dim}(V)$ is finite. 

Hence proved.
