## Theorem: Let \( V \) be a vector space over \( \mathbb{R} \). Suppose \( T: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is a linear transformation such that the null space of \( T \) is finite-dimensional. Show that \( V \) is finite dimensional. Hint. Recall that the dimension of \( \mathbb{R} \) as a vector space over \( \mathbb{R} \) is 1 .


## Proof: The null space of $T = N(T)$ is a space of finite dimension.

Let $dim N(T) = p$, where $p \in \mathbb{N}$.

Range($T$) = $R$
 
$dim (Range(T)) = dim(R) = 1$ (given hint).

By the Rank-Nullity Theorem:

$dim(N(T)) + dim(Range(T)) = dim(V)$

$p + 1 = dim(V)$.

Thus, $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space.
