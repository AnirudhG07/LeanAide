## Theorem: Let \( V \) be a vector space over \( \mathbb{R} \). Suppose \( T: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is a linear transformation such that the null space of \( T \) is finite-dimensional. Show that \( V \) is finite dimensional. Hint. Recall that the dimension of \( \mathbb{R} \) as a vector space over \( \mathbb{R} \) is 1 .


## Proof: Dimensional. (Hint: Recall that $\dim$ is a vector space over ($\mathbb{R}$, +, $\cdot$).

Since $R(T)$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$ (over $\mathbb{R}$),
 $$ \dim(R(T)) \leq \dim(\mathbb{R}) = 1\ (\text{as $R(T) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, the range space $R(T)$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$ (as a v.s. over $\mathbb{R}$)}). $$
$\implies \dim(R(T)) \leq 1$ 

So, either $\dim(R(T)) = 0$ or $\dim(R(T)) = 1$.

If $\dim(R(T)) = 0$, $\beta = \phi$ is a spanning set basis of $R(T)$ (as $\# \beta = 0$).
$\implies R(T) =$ span $\{\} =$ span $\{\vec{0}\}$.

Thus $T(\vec{v}) = \vec{0} \ \forall \vec{v} \in V$ (as $T(\vec{v}) \in R(T) \ \forall \vec{v} \in V$).

So, $\vec{v} \in N(T) \ \forall \vec{v} \in V$ (as $N(T) = \{\vec{v} \in V \mid T(\vec{v})=\vec{0}$). 
$\implies N(T) = V$. 

Then, since $N(T)$ is finite dimensional,
$V$ is also finite dimensional.

If $\dim(R(T)) = 1$, $\exists \ \vec{c} \in \mathbb{R} \backslash \{\vec{0}\}$ s.t. $\vec{c} \in R(T)$ since $R(T)$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$.

Let $\vec{u} \in \mathbb{R}$. 
Then, $\frac{1}{\alpha} \vec{u} \in \mathbb{R}$ ($\frac{1}{\alpha} \in \mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{R}$ is a field) since $\alpha \in \mathbb{R} \backslash \{0\}$, 
and $\frac{\vec{c}}{1} = \vec{c} \in \mathbb{R}$ s.t. $\vec{c} = \frac{\vec{c}}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{\alpha} \vec{u}$ ($\mathbb{R}$ is a field)
$\implies (\frac{1}{\alpha} \vec{u}) \vec{c} = \vec{u}(\frac{\vec{c}}{\alpha})$ since $\vec{c} \in R(T)$, $\alpha \neq 0 \in \mathbb{R}$ (as $\mathbb{R}$ is a vector space / field), $(\frac{\vec{u}}{\alpha})\cdot \vec{c} = \vec{u}(\frac{\vec{c}}{\alpha}) \in R(T)$ (as $R(T)$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$).
Since $\vec{u}$ is arbitrary, $\mathbb{R} \in R(T)$. 
$\implies R(T) = \mathbb{R}$.

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $n = \dim(N(T))$.
Then $\exists \vec{v}_1, ..., \vec{v}_n \in N(T)$ s.t. $B = \{\vec{v}_1, ..., \vec{v}_n\}$ is a basis of $N(T)$.

$\implies \dim(N(T)) + \dim(R(T)) = n + 1$, which is finite.

$\implies$ By rank nullity theorem, when $V$ is finite-dimensional.
$$\dim(V) = n+1$$ is finite and is equal to $n+1$.

(If $\dim V$ was not finite, $N(T)$ cannot have a finite dimension as $V$ can have vector sets linearly independent sets of any size $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that finitely many vectors in $V$ will map to $\vec{0} \in \mathbb{R}$.

## Cleaned-up Proof:

Since $R(T)$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$ (over $\mathbb{R}$), we have  $\dim(R(T)) \leq \dim(\mathbb{R}) = 1$. This follows from the fact that $R(T) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Therefore, we have two possibilities: either $\dim(R(T)) = 0$ or $\dim(R(T)) = 1$.

**Case 1:**  $\dim(R(T)) = 0$

In this case, the basis of $R(T)$ is the empty set, $\beta = \phi$, as it has zero elements. This implies that $R(T)$ is spanned by the zero vector: $R(T) =$ span $\{\} =$ span $\{\vec{0}\}$. Consequently, for any vector $\vec{v} \in V$, we have $T(\vec{v}) = \vec{0}$,  since $T(\vec{v})$ must belong to the range space $R(T)$. 

This means every vector in $V$ belongs to the null space of $T$: $\vec{v} \in N(T) \ \forall \vec{v} \in V$. This is because the null space is defined as $N(T) = \{\vec{v} \in V \mid T(\vec{v})=\vec{0}\}$. Therefore, we conclude that $N(T) = V$.

Since we are given that $N(T)$ is finite dimensional, and $N(T) = V$,  it follows that $V$ must also be finite dimensional.

**Case 2:**  $\dim(R(T)) = 1$

If the dimension of the range space is 1, then there exists a non-zero vector $\vec{c} \in \mathbb{R} \backslash \{\vec{0}\}$ such that $\vec{c} \in R(T)$.  This follows from the fact that $R(T)$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$.

Now, let's consider an arbitrary vector $\vec{u} \in \mathbb{R}$.  Since $\alpha$ is a non-zero element of the field $\mathbb{R}$ (i.e., $\alpha \in \mathbb{R} \backslash \{0\}$), we know that  $\frac{1}{\alpha} \vec{u}$ also belongs to  $\mathbb{R}$. Furthermore,  $\frac{\vec{c}}{1} = \vec{c} \in \mathbb{R}$. Using the field properties of $\mathbb{R}$, we can write $\vec{c}$ as $\vec{c} = \frac{\vec{c}}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{\alpha} \vec{u}$.  

This implies the following equality: $(\frac{1}{\alpha} \vec{u}) \vec{c} = \vec{u}(\frac{\vec{c}}{\alpha})$. Because  $\vec{c}$ belongs to the range space $R(T)$ and  $\alpha$ is a non-zero scalar, we know that $(\frac{\vec{u}}{\alpha})\cdot \vec{c} = \vec{u}(\frac{\vec{c}}{\alpha})$ also belongs to $R(T)$. This is because $R(T)$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$.

Since our choice of $\vec{u}$ was arbitrary, we can conclude that every element of $\mathbb{R}$ belongs to $R(T)$, implying  $\mathbb{R} \in R(T)$.  Therefore, we have $R(T) = \mathbb{R}$.

Now, let $n$ be the dimension of the null space of $T$, denoted as $n = \dim(N(T))$. This means there exists a basis for $N(T)$ consisting of $n$ vectors, say  $B = \{\vec{v}_1, ..., \vec{v}_n\}$, where each $\vec{v}_i$ belongs to $N(T)$.

The dimension of the sum of the null space and range space is then  $\dim(N(T)) + \dim(R(T)) = n + 1$, which is a finite value.  

Using the Rank-Nullity Theorem, which applies when $V$ is finite-dimensional, we can conclude that the dimension of $V$ is  $\dim(V) = n+1$. This shows that $V$ is finite dimensional.

Finally, let's consider the case where $\dim V$ is not finite. In this scenario, $N(T)$ cannot have a finite dimension. This is because  $V$ would contain linearly independent sets of vectors of any size. Therefore, we would always be able to find finitely many vectors in $V$ that map to the zero vector $\vec{0} \in \mathbb{R}$.
