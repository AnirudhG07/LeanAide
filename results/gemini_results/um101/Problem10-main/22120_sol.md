## Theorem: Let \( V \) be a vector space over \( \mathbb{R} \). Suppose \( T: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is a linear transformation such that the null space of \( T \) is finite-dimensional. Show that \( V \) is finite dimensional. Hint. Recall that the dimension of \( \mathbb{R} \) as a vector space over \( \mathbb{R} \) is 1 .


## Proof: For any linear transformation $T\colon V \to \mathbb{R}$, the null space is given by $N(T)$ and the range space is given by $R(T)$. As $R(T)$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$, $\dim(R(T)) \leq \dim{\mathbb{R}} \implies \dim(R(T)) \leq 1$. $R(T)$ is finite dimensional. 
By the rank-nullity theorem, $\dim(R(T)) + \dim(N(T)) = \dim(V)$. As both $R(T)$ and $N(T)$ are finite dimensional, $V$ must be finite dimensional. 
If $V$ is infinite dimensional, as $R(T)$ is finite dimensional $\implies N(T)$ is infinite dimensional which is a contradiction.
