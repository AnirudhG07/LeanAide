 Fundamental theorem of calculus-1, local version for any measure. Let filters `l` and `l'` be related by `[FTC_filter a l l']`; let `Œº` be a locally finite measure. If `f` has a finite limit `c` at `l' ‚äì Œº.ae`, then `‚à´ x in u..v, f x ‚àÇŒº = ‚à´ x in u..v, c ‚àÇŒº + o(‚à´ x in u..v, 1 ‚àÇŒº)` as both `u` and `v` tend to `l`.  See also `measure_integral_sub_linear_is_o_of_tendsto_ae'` for a version that also works, e.g., for `l = l' = at_top`.  We use integrals of constants instead of measures because this way it is easier to formulate a statement that works in both cases `u ‚â§ v` and `v ‚â§ u`.

 This is Exercise 1.2.1 from [tao2010]. It allows you to express integration of a measurable function with respect to `(Œº.with_density f)` as an integral with respect to `Œº`, called the base measure. `Œº` is often the Lebesgue measure, and in this circumstance `f` is the probability density function, and `(Œº.with_density f)` represents any continuous random variable as a probability measure, such as the uniform distribution between 0 and 1, the Gaussian distribution, the exponential distribution, the Beta distribution, or the Cauchy distribution (see Section 2.4 of [wasserman2004]). Thus, this method shows how to one can calculate expectations, variances, and other moments as a function of the probability density function.

 A version of **Dickson's lemma** any subset of functions `Œ† s : œÉ, Œ± s` is partially well ordered, when `œÉ` is a `fintype` and each `Œ± s` is a linear well order.

This theorem establishes **Leibniz's series for `œÄ`**: The alternating sum of the reciprocals  of the odd numbers is `œÄ/4`. Note that this is a conditionally rather than absolutely convergent  series. The main tool that this proof uses is the Mean Value Theorem (specifically avoiding the  Fundamental Theorem of Calculus).   Intuitively, the theorem holds because Leibniz's series is the Taylor series of `arctan x`  centered about `0` and evaluated at the value `x = 1`. Therefore, much of this proof consists of  reasoning about a function    `f := arctan x - ‚àë i in finset.range k, (-(1:‚Ñù))^i * x^(2*i+1) / (2*i+1)`,  the difference between `arctan` and the `k`-th partial sum of its Taylor series. Some ingenuity is  required due to the fact that the Taylor series is not absolutely convergent at `x = 1`.   This proof requires a bound on `f 1`, the key idea being that `f 1` can be split as the sum of  `f 1 - f u` and `f u`, where `u` is a sequence of values in [0,1], carefully chosen such that  each of these two terms can be controlled (in different ways).   We begin the proof by (1) introducing that sequence `u` and then proving that another sequence  constructed from `u` tends to `0` at `+‚àû`. After (2) converting the limit in our goal to an  inequality, we (3) introduce the auxiliary function `f` defined above. Next, we (4) compute the  derivative of `f`, denoted by `f'`, first generally and then on each of two subintervals of [0,1].  We then (5) prove a bound for `f'`, again both generally as well as on each of the two  subintervals. Finally, we (6) apply the Mean Value Theorem twice, obtaining bounds on `f 1 - f u`  and `f u - f 0` from the bounds on `f'` (note that `f 0 = 0`).
 **Strict inequality case of Rearrangement Inequality**: Pointwise scalar multiplication of `f` and `g`, which monovary together, is strictly decreased by a permutation if and only if `f` and `g ‚àò œÉ` do not monovary together. Stated by permuting the entries of `g`.

This theorem establishes the Wallis Product for `œÄ`. Our proof is largely about analyzing  the behavior of the ratio of the integral of `sin x ^ n` as `n ‚Üí ‚àû`.  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_product   The proof can be broken down into two pieces.  (Pieces involving general properties of the integral of `sin x ^n` can be found  in `analysis.special_functions.integrals`.) First, we use integration by parts to obtain a  recursive formula for `‚à´ x in 0..œÄ, sin x ^ (n + 2)` in terms of `‚à´ x in 0..œÄ, sin x ^ n`.  From this we can obtain closed form products of `‚à´ x in 0..œÄ, sin x ^ (2 * n)` and  `‚à´ x in 0..œÄ, sin x ^ (2 * n + 1)` via induction. Next, we study the behavior of the ratio  `‚à´ (x : ‚Ñù) in 0..œÄ, sin x ^ (2 * k + 1)) / ‚à´ (x : ‚Ñù) in 0..œÄ, sin x ^ (2 * k)` and prove that  it converges to one using the squeeze theorem.

It is formulated in terms of two functions `f g : ‚Ñù √ó ‚Ñù ‚Üí E` and iterated integral `‚à´ x in a‚ÇÅ..b‚ÇÅ, ‚à´ y in a‚ÇÇ..b‚ÇÇ, _`, where `a‚ÇÅ a‚ÇÇ b‚ÇÅ b‚ÇÇ : ‚Ñù`. When thinking of `f` and `g` as the two coordinates of a single function `F : ‚Ñù √ó ‚Ñù ‚Üí E √ó E` and when `E = ‚Ñù`, this is the usual statement that the integral of the divergence of `F` inside the rectangle with vertices `(a·µ¢, b‚±º)`, `i, j =1,2`, equals the integral of the normal derivative of `F` along the boundary.  See also `measure_theory.integral_divergence_prod_Icc_of_has_fderiv_within_at_off_countable_of_le` for a version that uses an integral over `Icc a b`, where `a b : ‚Ñù √ó ‚Ñù`, `a ‚â§ b`.

 Let `Z, N` be types, let `R` be a metric space, let `Œ± : R` be a point and let `j : Z ‚Üí N ‚Üí R` be a function.  We aim to estimate how close we can get to `Œ±`, while staying in the image of `j`.  The points `j z a` of `R` in the image of `j` come with a "cost" equal to `d a`.  As we get closer to `Œ±` while staying in the image of `j`, we are interested in bounding the quantity `d a * dist Œ± (j z a)` from below by a strictly positive amount `1 / A`: the intuition is that approximating well `Œ±` with the points in the image of `j` should come at a high cost.  The hypotheses on the function `f : R ‚Üí R` provide us with sufficient conditions to ensure our goal. The first hypothesis is that `f` is Lipschitz at `Œ±`: this yields a bound on the distance. The second hypothesis is specific to the Liouville argument and provides the missing bound involving the cost function `d`.  This lemma collects the properties used in the proof of `exists_pos_real_of_irrational_root`. It is stated in more general form than needed: in the intended application, `Z = ‚Ñ§`, `N = ‚Ñï`, `R = ‚Ñù`, `d a = (a + 1) ^ f.nat_degree`, `j z a  = z / (a + 1)`, `f ‚àà ‚Ñ§[x]`, `Œ±` is an irrational root of `f`, `Œµ` is small, `M` is a bound on the Lipschitz constant of `f` near `Œ±`, `n` is the degree of the polynomial `f`.

If `f` and `g` are independent random variables with values in `‚Ñù‚â•0‚àû`,   then `E[f * g] = E[f] * E[g]`. However, instead of directly using the independence   of the random variables, it uses the independence of measurable spaces for the   domains of `f` and `g`. This is similar to the sigma-algebra approach to   independence. See `lintegral_mul_eq_lintegral_mul_lintegral_of_independent_fn` for   a more common variant of the product of independent variables.
 Reindexing both indices along the same equivalence preserves the determinant.  For the `simp` version of this lemma, see `det_minor_equiv_self`; this one is unsuitable because `matrix.reindex_apply` unfolds `reindex` first.

This formulation assumes:  * the functions tend to a limit along a countably generated filter;  * the limit is in the almost everywhere sense;  * boundedness holds almost everywhere;  * integration is `lintegral`, i.e., the functions and their integrals are `‚Ñù‚â•0‚àû`-valued.

 Two `R`-linear maps from `finsupp X M` which agree on each `single x y` agree everywhere.  We formulate this fact using equality of linear maps `œÜ.comp (lsingle a)` and `œà.comp (lsingle a)` so that the `ext` tactic can apply a type-specific extensionality lemma to prove equality of these maps. E.g., if `M = R`, then it suffices to verify `œÜ (single a 1) = œà (single a 1)`.

 If `f` and `g` are two exact solutions of the same ODE, then the distance between them can't grow faster than exponentially. This is a simple corollary of Gr√∂nwall's inequality, and some people call this Gr√∂nwall's inequality too.

 The derivative of the zero section of the tangent bundle maps `‚ü®x, v‚ü©` to `‚ü®‚ü®x, 0‚ü©, ‚ü®v, 0‚ü©‚ü©`.  Note that, as currently framed, this is a statement in coordinates, thus reliant on the choice of the coordinate system we use on the tangent bundle.  However, the result itself is coordinate-dependent only to the extent that the coordinates determine a splitting of the tangent bundle.  Moreover, there is a canonical splitting at each point of the zero section (since there is a canonical horizontal space there, the tangent space to the zero section, in addition to the canonical vertical space which is the kernel of the derivative of the projection), and this canonical splitting is also the one that comes from the coordinates on the tangent bundle in our definitions. So this statement is not as crazy as it may seem.  TODO define splittings of vector bundles; state this result invariantly.

Given a group action of `G` on `X` so that the `H i` acts in a specific way on disjoint subsets `X i` we can prove that `lift f` is injective, and thus the image of `lift f` is isomorphic to the direct product of the `H i`.

We could potentially slightly weaken the conditions, by not requiring that `f'` and `g` are continuous on the endpoints of these intervals, but in that case we need to additionally assume that the functions are integrable on that interval.

Shows the correctness of `comp_exact_value` in case the continued fraction `generalized_continued_fraction.of v` did not terminate at position `n`. That is, we obtain the value `v` if we pass the two successive (auxiliary) continuants at positions `n` and `n + 1` as well as the fractional part at `int_fract_pair.stream n` to `comp_exact_value`.  The correctness might be seen more readily if one uses `convergents'` to evaluate the continued fraction. Here is an example to illustrate the idea:  Let `(v : ‚Ñö) := 3.4`. We have - `generalized_continued_fraction.int_fract_pair.stream v 0 = some ‚ü®3, 0.4‚ü©`, and - `generalized_continued_fraction.int_fract_pair.stream v 1 = some ‚ü®2, 0.5‚ü©`. Now `(generalized_continued_fraction.of v).convergents' 1 = 3 + 1/2`, and our fractional term at position `2` is `0.5`. We hence have `v = 3 + 1/(2 + 0.5) = 3 + 1/2.5 = 3.4`. This computation corresponds exactly to the one using the recurrence equation in `comp_exact_value`.

 Let `X` be a locally compact sigma compact Hausdorff topological space. Suppose that for each `x` the sets `B x : Œπ x ‚Üí set X` with the predicate `p x : Œπ x ‚Üí Prop` form a basis of the filter `ùìù x`. Then there exists a locally finite covering `Œª i, B (c i) (r i)` of `X` such that each `r i` satisfies `p (c i)`  The notation is inspired by the case `B x r = metric.ball x r` but the theorem applies to `nhds_basis_opens` as well. If the covering must be subordinate to some open covering of `s`, then the user should use a basis obtained by `filter.has_basis.restrict_subset` or a similar lemma, see the proof of `paracompact_of_locally_compact_sigma_compact` for an example.  The formalization is based on two [ncatlab](https://ncatlab.org/) proofs: * [locally compact and sigma compact spaces are paracompact](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+compact+and+sigma-compact+spaces+are+paracompact); * [open cover of smooth manifold admits locally finite refinement by closed balls](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/partition+of+unity#ExistenceOnSmoothManifolds).  See also `refinement_of_locally_compact_sigma_compact_of_nhds_basis_set` for a version of this lemma dealing with a covering of a closed set.

 Two finite measures on a Borel space are equal if they agree on all left-infinite right-closed intervals.
 A custom induction principle for fintypes. The base case is a subsingleton type, and the induction step is for non-trivial types, and one can assume the hypothesis for smaller types (via `fintype.card`).  The major premise is `fintype Œ±`, so to use this with the `induction` tactic you have to give a name to that instance and use that name.

 Suppose `œÄ i` is a family of topological spaces indexed by `i : Œπ`, and `X` is a type endowed with a family of maps `f i : X ‚Üí œÄ i` for every `i : Œπ`, hence inducing a map `g : X ‚Üí Œ† i, œÄ i`.

 **Phragmen-Lindel√∂f principle** in a strip `U = {z : ‚ÑÇ | a < im z < b}`. Let `f : ‚ÑÇ ‚Üí E` be a function such that  * `f` is differentiable on `U` and is continuous on its closure; * `‚à•f z‚à•` is bounded from above by `A * exp(B * exp(c * |re z|))` on `U` for some `c < œÄ / (b - a)`; * `‚à•f z‚à•` is bounded from above by a constant `C` on the boundary of `U`.  Then `‚à•f z‚à•` is bounded by the same constant on the closed strip `{z : ‚ÑÇ | a ‚â§ im z ‚â§ b}`. Moreover, it suffices to verify the second assumption only for sufficiently large values of `|re z|`.

 If a compact interval `[a, b]` is covered by a union of open interval `(c i, d i)`, then `f b - f a ‚â§ ‚àë f (d i) - f (c i)`.

 Postcomposition of a continuous linear map with a linear isometry preserves the operator norm.
`z - (to_zmod z : ‚Ñ§_[p])` is contained in the maximal ideal of `‚Ñ§_[p]`, for every `z : ‚Ñ§_[p]`.  The coercion from `zmod p` to `‚Ñ§_[p]` is `zmod.has_coe_t`, which coerces `zmod p` into artibrary rings. This is unfortunate, but a consequence of the fact that we allow `zmod p` to coerce to rings of arbitrary characteristic, instead of only rings of characteristic `p`. This coercion is only a ring homomorphism if it coerces into a ring whose characteristic divides `p`. While this is not the case here we can still make use of the coercion.

If `G : C ‚•§ D` is a functor which reflects isomorphisms and preserves limits (we assume all limits exist in both `C` and `D`), then checking the sheaf condition for a presheaf `F : presheaf C X` is equivalent to checking the sheaf condition for `F ‚ãô G`.  The important special case is when `C` is a concrete category with a forgetful functor that preserves limits and reflects isomorphisms. Then to check the sheaf condition it suffices to check it on the underlying sheaf of types.  Another useful example is the forgetful functor `TopCommRing ‚•§ Top`.  See <https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0073>. In fact we prove a stronger version with arbitrary complete target category.

Indeed, given `I : lie_ideal R L`, in general the two lattices `lie_ideal R I` and `lie_submodule R L I` are different (though the latter does naturally inject into the former).  In other words, in general, ideals of `I`, regarded as a Lie algebra in its own right, are not the same as ideals of `L` contained in `I`.

A technical lemma relating two different measures. This is basically [Halmos, ¬ß60 Th. A].  Note that if `f` is the characteristic function of a measurable set `F` this states that  `Œº F = c * Œº E` for a constant `c` that does not depend on `Œº`.

 Let `p` be a predicate on `box Œπ`, let `I` be a box. Suppose that the following two properties hold true.  * `H_ind` : Consider a smaller box `J ‚â§ I`. The hyperplanes passing through the center of `J` split   it into `2 ^ n` boxes. If `p` holds true on each of these boxes, then it true on `J`.  * `H_nhds` : For each `z` in the closed box `I.Icc` there exists a neighborhood `U` of `z` within   `I.Icc` such that for every box `J ‚â§ I` such that `z ‚àà J.Icc ‚äÜ U`, if `J` is homothetic to `I`   with a coefficient of the form `1 / 2 ^ m`, then `p` is true on `J`.

 Fundamental theorem of calculus for set integrals: if `Œº` is a measure that is finite at a filter `l` and `f` is a measurable function that has a finite limit `b` at `l ‚äì Œº.ae`, then `‚à´ x in s i, f x ‚àÇŒº = Œº (s i) ‚Ä¢ b + o(Œº (s i))` at a filter `li` provided that `s i` tends to `l.small_sets` along `li`.

 Let `X` be a locally compact sigma compact Hausdorff topological space, let `s` be a closed set in `X`. Suppose that for each `x ‚àà s` the sets `B x : Œπ x ‚Üí set X` with the predicate `p x : Œπ x ‚Üí Prop` form a basis of the filter `ùìù x`. Then there exists a locally finite covering `Œª i, B (c i) (r i)` of `s` such that all ‚Äúcenters‚Äù `c i` belong to `s` and each `r i` satisfies `p (c i)`.  The notation is inspired by the case `B x r = metric.ball x r` but the theorem applies to `nhds_basis_opens` as well. If the covering must be subordinate to some open covering of `s`, then the user should use a basis obtained by `filter.has_basis.restrict_subset` or a similar lemma, see the proof of `paracompact_of_locally_compact_sigma_compact` for an example.  The formalization is based on two [ncatlab](https://ncatlab.org/) proofs: * [locally compact and sigma compact spaces are paracompact](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+compact+and+sigma-compact+spaces+are+paracompact); * [open cover of smooth manifold admits locally finite refinement by closed balls](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/partition+of+unity#ExistenceOnSmoothManifolds).  See also `refinement_of_locally_compact_sigma_compact_of_nhds_basis` for a version of this lemma dealing with a covering of the whole space.  In most cases (namely, if `B c r ‚à™ B c r'` is again a set of the form `B c r''`) it is possible to choose `Œ± = X`. This fact is not yet formalized in `mathlib`.

In other words, the limit inferior of this ratio as `z` tends to `x+0` is less than or equal to `‚à•f'‚à•`.  See also  * `has_deriv_within_at.limsup_norm_slope_le` for a stronger version using   limit superior and any set `s`; * `has_deriv_within_at.liminf_right_norm_slope_le` for a stronger version using   `‚à•f z - f x‚à•` instead of `‚à•f z‚à• - ‚à•f x‚à•`.

 This is a useful lemma to prove that a certain operation preserves functions being `C^n`. When you do induction on `n`, this gives a useful characterization of a function being `C^(n+1)`, assuming you have already computed the derivative. The advantage of this version over `cont_diff_succ_iff_fderiv` is that both occurences of `cont_diff` are for functions with the same domain and codomain (`E` and `F`). This is not the case for `cont_diff_succ_iff_fderiv`, which often requires an inconvenient need to generalize `F`, which results in universe issues (see the discussion in the section of `cont_diff.comp`).  This lemma avoids these universe issues, but only applies for finite dimensional `E`.

We require the index type `Œπ` to be encodable, and usually `Œπ = ‚Ñï`.  In other words, a sequence of almost everywhere convergent functions converges uniformly except on an arbitrarily small set.

 Fundamental theorem of calculus-1, local version for any measure. Let filters `l` and `l'` be related by `tendsto_Ixx_class Ioc`. If `f` has a finite limit `c` at `l' ‚äì Œº.ae`, where `Œº` is a measure finite at `l'`, then `‚à´ x in u..v, f x ‚àÇŒº = ‚à´ x in u..v, c ‚àÇŒº + o(‚à´ x in u..v, 1 ‚àÇŒº)` as both `u` and `v` tend to `l`.  See also `measure_integral_sub_linear_is_o_of_tendsto_ae` for a version assuming `[FTC_filter a l l']` and `[is_locally_finite_measure Œº]`. If `l` is one of `ùìù[‚â•] a`, `ùìù[‚â§] a`, `ùìù a`, then it's easier to apply the non-primed version. The primed version also works, e.g., for `l = l' = at_top`.  We use integrals of constants instead of measures because this way it is easier to formulate a statement that works in both cases `u ‚â§ v` and `v ‚â§ u`.

Higman's Lemma, which states that for any reflexive, transitive relation `r` which is  partially well-ordered on a set `s`, the relation `list.sublist_forall‚ÇÇ r` is partially  well-ordered on the set of lists of elements of `s`. That relation is defined so that  `list.sublist_forall‚ÇÇ r l‚ÇÅ l‚ÇÇ` whenever `l‚ÇÅ` related pointwise by `r` to a sublist of `l‚ÇÇ`.
We can compute a left derived functor on a morphism using a lift of that morphism to a chain map between chosen projective resolutions.

 If one adds to a vector `m'` another vector `m`, but only for coordinates in a finset `t`, then the image under a multilinear map `f` is the sum of `f (s.piecewise m m')` along all subsets `s` of `t`.

See `counterexamples/direct_sum_is_internal.lean` for a proof of this fact.
 The measurable Besicovitch covering theorem. Assume that, for any `x` in a set `s`, one is given a set of admissible closed balls centered at `x`, with arbitrarily small radii. Then there exists a disjoint covering of almost all `s` by admissible closed balls centered at some points of `s`. This version requires that the underlying measure is finite, and that the space has the Besicovitch covering property (which is satisfied for instance by normed real vector spaces). It expresses the conclusion in a slightly awkward form (with a subset of `Œ± √ó ‚Ñù`) coming from the proof technique. For a version assuming that the measure is sigma-finite, see `exists_disjoint_closed_ball_covering_ae_aux`. For a version giving the conclusion in a nicer form, see `exists_disjoint_closed_ball_covering_ae`.

 A sufficient condition to prove that `f ‚ãÜ[L, Œº] g` exists. We assume that the integrand has compact support and `g` is bounded on this support (note that both properties hold if `g` is continuous with compact support).

 Consider a function `f : Œ± √ó Œ≤ ‚Üí Œ≥`.

 Shows that the recurrence relation (`convergents`) and direct evaluation (`convergents'`) of the gcf coincide at position `n` if the sequence of fractions contains strictly positive values only.

In practice, one most commonly deals with (regular) continued fractions, which satisfy the positivity criterion required here. The analogous result for them (see `continued_fractions.convergents_eq_convergents`) hence follows directly from this theorem.
