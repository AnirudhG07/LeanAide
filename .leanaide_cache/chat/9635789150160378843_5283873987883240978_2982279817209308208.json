    "Let \\( n \\) be a natural number. Consider the product of \\( n \\) and \\( n+1 \\), which is \\( n(n+1) \\). \n\nWe proceed by inspecting two cases for \\( n \\):\n1. If \\( n \\) is even, then \\( n = 2k \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Therefore, the product is \\( n(n+1) = 2k(n+1) \\), which is clearly even, as it is a multiple of 2.\n2. If \\( n \\) is odd, then \\( n = 2k+1 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Therefore, the product is \\( n(n+1) = (2k+1)(2k+2) = 2k(2k+2) + 2 = 2(k(2k+2) + 1) \\), which is also even, as it is a multiple of 2.\n\nIn either case, \\( n(n+1) \\) is even. Thus, the product of two consecutive natural numbers is always even."},
