A zero object in a category is an object that is both a initial object and a terminal object. A morphism being zero means that it is the same as the unique morphism to the zero object from the domain of the morphism. Preadditive categories are categories in which the hom-sets are abelian groups and composition of morphisms is bilinear. Shift functors are a kind of functor used in the context of triangulated categories to understand the shifts in the morphisms.","concise-description":" In a pretriangulated preadditive category with shift functors and a zero object, a distinguished triangle with zero first and second morphisms has a zero second object."}]]
