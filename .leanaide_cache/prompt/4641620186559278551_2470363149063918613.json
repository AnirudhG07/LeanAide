","description":"This theorem provides an explicit formula for the Riemann zeta function `ζ(s)` at even positive integers, specifically `ζ(2k)` for `k` as a non-zero natural number. The theorem states that `ζ(2k)` can be calculated as `(-1)^(k+1) * 2^(2k-1) * π^(2k) * Bernoulli(2k) / (2k)!`. The Bernoulli number used here is defined with a parity sign and `π` is defined as twice a zero of cosine in the interval [1, 2]. Note also equivalent formulations for other values at negative integers via the functional equation and for a version formulated explicitly as a sum.","concise-description":" The Riemann zeta function `ζ(2k)` for a non-zero natural number `k` equals `(-1)^(k+1) * 2^(2k-1) * π^(2k) * Bernoulli(2k) / (2k)!`, where `π` is defined as twice a zero of cosine in the interval [1, 2] and `Bernoulli(2k)` denotes the Bernoulli number with the given parity sign."}]]
