In other words, `Nat.div2 n` gives the greatest integer that is less than or equal to `n/2`. This theorem provides a formal proof in Lean 4 that this function indeed behaves as expected based on its definition.","concise-description":" For every natural number `n`, `Nat.div2 n` equals the floor of `n/2`."}]]
