In other words, if you take any natural number, add 2 to it, and then divide by the smallest prime factor of the resulting number, the result will always be less than the original number plus 2.","concise-description":" For every natural number `k`, the quotient of `k + 2` by the smallest prime factor of `k + 2` is strictly less than `k + 2`."}]]
