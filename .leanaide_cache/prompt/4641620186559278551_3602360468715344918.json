Specifically, for any type `R` that has operations of multiplication (`Mul R`) and addition (`Add R`) and follows the left distributive law (`LeftDistribClass R`), the theorem states that for any three elements `a`, `b`, and `c` of `R`, the result of multiplying `a` by the sum of `b` and `c` is equal to the sum of `a` multiplied by `b` and `a` multiplied by `c`. In mathematical terms, this is the well-known property `a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c`.","concise-description":" For any element `a` in a commutative ring `R` with one and multiplicative identity, `a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c` holds for all `b, c` in `R`."}]]
