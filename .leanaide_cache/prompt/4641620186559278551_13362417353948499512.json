","description":"This theorem states that for any given ring `R`, the zero element of that ring is always a member of any subring `s` of `R`. In other words, it confirms that zero, which is an identity element of addition in the ring, is also included in all of its subrings, in accordance with the definition of a subring in ring theory.","concise-description":" For any subring `s` of a ring `R`, the additive identity (zero) of `R` is an element of `s`."}]]
