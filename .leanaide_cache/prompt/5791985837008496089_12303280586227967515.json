","description":"The theorem `Odd.ne_two_of_dvd_nat` asserts that for all natural numbers `m` and `n`, if `n` is an odd number, and `m` divides `n`, then `m` cannot be `2`. This means that `2` cannot be a factor of an odd number. In more mathematical terms, for all natural numbers `m` and `n`, if there exists a natural number `k` such that `n = 2*k + 1` (implying `n` is odd) and `m` divides `n`, then `m` must not equal `2`.","concise-description":" For all natural numbers `m` and `n`, if `n` is odd and `m` divides `n`, then `m` does not equal `2`."}]]
