For any semigroup `G` and any three elements `a`, `b`, and `c` of `G`, the operation of multiplication is associative. In other words, the order in which the multiplication operations are performed does not affect the result: `(a * b) * c` is the same as `a * (b * c)`.","concise-description":" In any semigroup, the multiplication is associative: `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)` for all elements `a`, `b`, and `c`."}]]
