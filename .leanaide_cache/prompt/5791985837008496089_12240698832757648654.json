According to the theorem, a natural number `n` is odd if and only if `n` modulo 2 equals 1. This is equivalent to the definition of oddness in semirings, where an element `a` of a semiring is considered odd if there exists a `k` such that `a` is equal to `2*k + 1`.\n","concise-description":" A natural number `n` is equivalent to being odd, as defined in Lean 4, if and only if `n` modulo 2 equals 1, which is equivalent to `n` being expressible as `2*k + 1` for some natural number `k`."}]]
