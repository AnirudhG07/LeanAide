This means that `2` cannot be a factor of an odd number. In more mathematical terms, for all natural numbers `m` and `n`, if there exists a natural number `k` such that `n = 2*k + 1` (implying `n` is odd) and `m` divides `n`, then `m` must not equal `2`.","concise-description":" For all natural numbers `m` and `n`, if `n` is odd and `m` divides `n`, then `m` does not equal `2`."}],[" For any natural number n, n is not a divisor of itself when considering only proper divisors (i.e., divisors strictly less than and greater than n).",{"value":null,"type":"∀ {n : ℕ}, n ∉ n.properDivisors","statement":"theorem Nat.properDivisors.not_self_mem : ∀ {n : ℕ}, n ∉ n.properDivisors := by sorry","name":"Nat.properDivisors.not_self_mem","isProp":true,"description":"This theorem states that for any natural number 'n', 'n' is not a member of its own proper divisors set.
