In other words, an integer `n` satisfies the property `Even`--meaning there exists some other integer `r` such that `n = r + r`--if and only if the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 is 0. This is a formalization of the usual mathematical definition of even numbers in the integers.","concise-description":" An integer `n` is even if and only if `n` modulo 2 equals 0."}]]
