We show that the expected fraction $p(n)$ of unpaired bases in an optimal RNA secondary structure (with only Watson-Crick bonds and no pseudo-knots) converges to a constant $λ_2$ with $0 < λ_2 < 1$ as $n → ∞$. Thus, a positive proportion of the bases of a random RNA string do not form hydrogen bonds. We do not know the exact value of $λ_2$, but we derive upper and lower bounds for it. In terms of free groups, $p(n)$ is the ratio of the length of the shortest word representing $X$ in the generating set consisting of conjugates of generators and their inverses to the word length of $X$ with respect to the standard generators and their inverses. Thus for a typical word the word length in the (infinite) generating set consisting of the conjugates of standard generators grows linearly with the word length in the standard generators. In fact, we show that a similar result holds for all non-abelian finitely generated free groups $(α_1,..., α_k), k ≥ 2$.\"\n",

All features of the stationary distribution, namely the product form with exponents being $a_is$ and the values of $τ_is$ were arrived at by extensive checking on Mathematica software for several values of $k$, along with some guess work. On a computer, one must restrict to finite state space chains, and a natural restriction is to words of length at most $L$ (steps outside this are forbidden). If $π_L$ is the stationary distribution of this Markov chain, then not only does $π_L$ converge to $π$, but curiously $π_L(w) = π(w)$ for all $w$ of length $L – 1$ or less!\"\n",
