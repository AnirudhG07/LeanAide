An object can also have a \"name\" field, which is a string, to be used for reference (for instance it may be the name of a theorem).

If \\\\(N\\\\) is not prime, it must have a prime factor not in our list, since otherwise, \\\\(N\\\\) would be divisible by 10, which it is not (its last digit is 7). Any prime factor of \\\\(N\\\\) not among \\\\(p_1, \\\\ldots, p_n\\\\) that divides \\\\(N\\\\) cannot end in 1, 3, or 9, for such a factor would make \\\\(N\\\\) end in a digit other than 7, given the form of \\\\(N\\\\). Thus, this prime factor must end in 7, providing the contradiction. \\n\\nHence, there must be infinitely many primes with last digit 7.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nWrite the following proof in the JSON format. Note that the proof may be incorrect. If any step is incorrect, ambiguous or needs more proof, add a field **error** to any of the above types of objects. The **error** field should be a string describing the error. \\n\\n'"

Prove that $f$ is unbounded.\\n## Proof: \\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $f$ is bounded. Then there exist real numbers $M$ and $m$ such that $m \\\\leq f(x) \\\\leq M$ for all $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$. Since $f$ is continuous on $\\\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\\\mathbb{R}$ is connected, $f(\\\\mathbb{R})$ is also connected in $\\\\mathbb{R}$, implying that $f(\\\\mathbb{R})$ is an interval. Given that $f(\\\\mathbb{R})$ is bounded and connected, it must be a closed interval $[m, M]$. \\n\\nBecause $f\\'\\'(x) > 0$ for all $x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is strictly convex. This means that for any two points $x_1, x_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}$, with $x_1 < x_2$, the line segment connecting $(x_1, f(x_1))$ and $(x_2, f(x_2))$ lies above the graph of $f$ for all $x \\\\in (x_1, x_2)$. This implies that $f$ cannot have both a maximum and a minimum value in $\\\\mathbb{R}$ since a strict convex function is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing beyond some points on the real line. \\n\\nHowever, our assumption that $f$ is bounded above by $M$ and below by $m$ implies that $f$ has both a maximum and a minimum value in $\\\\mathbb{R}$, which contradicts the property of strict convexity. This contradiction arises from the assumption that $f$ is bounded. Therefore, $f$ must be unbounded.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nWrite the following proof in the JSON format. Note that the proof may be incorrect. If any step is incorrect, ambiguous or needs more proof, add a field **error** to any of the above types of objects. The **error** field should be a string describing the error. \\n\\n'"

Expanding and simplifying, we get $g(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1$. Now, applying Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$, we observe that $p$ divides all the coefficients of $g(x)$ except the leading coefficient, $p^2$ does not divide the constant term, and the leading coefficient is not divisible by $p$. Therefore, $g(x)$ is irreducible over the rationals, which implies that $f(x)$ is also irreducible over the rationals.\n"
