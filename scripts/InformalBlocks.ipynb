A free group on a set is a construction in abstract algebra which provides the \"simplest\" group containing the set.

      "\n",
      "1. For any $k \\in K$, consider $[e] \\in Q$ where $e$ is the identity in $G$. Then, $k^{[e]} = k^e = kek^{-1} = k$. Thus, the identity condition holds.\n",

      "2. For all $k \\in K$ and $[g_1], [g_2] \\in Q$, we have:\n",
      "   $k^{[g_1][g_2]} = k^{[g_1g_2]} = k^{g_1g_2} = (g_1g_2)k(g_1g_2)^{-1} = g_1(g_2kg_2^{-1})g_1^{-1} = g_1(k^{g_2})g_1^{-1} = (k^{g_2})^{g_1} = k^{[g_2]}^{[g_1]} = [g_1] \u0007st ([g_2] \u0007st k)$.\n",

      "Details:\n",
      "The claim made in the paragraph is that given $G$ to be a group with an abelian normal subgroup $K$ such that $Q=G/K$ is also abelian, then because $K$ is abelian, the conjugation action of $G$ on $K$ induces a group action of $Q$ on $K$.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can justify this claim in the following way:\n",
      "\n",
      "The conjugation action of a group $G$ on itself is defined by $g \\cdot h = ghg^{-1}$. When we restrict this action to a normal subgroup $K$ of $G$, we get a well-defined action of $G$ on $K$. This is because for $k, k' \\in K$, we have $g \\cdot (kk') = gkk'g^{-1} = (gkg^{-1})(gk'g^{-1}) = g \\cdot k \\cdot g \\cdot k'$, which shows that the action respects the group operation of $K$.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, if $g, g' \\in G$ are such that their images in $Q$ under the quotient map $p: G \\to Q$ are equal, i.e. $p(g) = p(g')$, then $g^{-1}g' \\in K$. Thus, for every $k \\in K$, we have \n",
      "\n",
      "$g \\cdot k = gkg^{-1} = g'k(g')^{-1} = g' \\cdot k$.\n",
      "\n",
      "This shows that elements of $G$ that become equal in $Q$ act in the same way on $K$. This is the defining property of an action of $Q$ on $K$ that is induced by the action of $G$ on $K$.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we have shown that indeed the conjugation action of $G$ on $K$ induces a group action of $Q$ on $K$. This completes the proof.\n",
