A free group on a set is a construction in abstract algebra which provides the \"simplest\" group containing the set.

      "The Lean code defines an inductive type `DiaphontineSolution` for representing solutions of diophantine equations of the form `ax + by = c` where `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` are integers. There are two possible cases:\n",

      "1. `solution`: There exists integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = c`.\n",

If the gcd of `a` and `b` does not divide `c`, it concludes that the equation is unsolvable. The justification for this conclusion is that if `ax + by = c` had a solution, then by the lemma `eqn_solvable_divides`, the gcd of `a` and `b` would divide `c`, contradicting the assumption that it does not.\n",

The `solution` constructor takes four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and two integers `x` and `y` such that `a*x + b*y = c`.
