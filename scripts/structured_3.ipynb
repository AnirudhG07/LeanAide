An object can also have a \"name\" field, which is a string, to be used for reference (for instance it may be the name of a theorem). The different types of objects and their additional fields are as follows:\\n\\n* **Fix**: For a statement introducing a new variable.\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **Variable**: the variable being defined.\\n    * **Kind**: the type and (optionally) properties of the variable.\\n* **Let**: For a statement introducing a new variable which has a given explicit value.\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **Variable**: the variable being defined.\\n    * **Value**: the value being assigned to the variable.\\n* **Have**: This is an anonymous let/fix statement, introducing an anonymous object such as a topology, group action etc to be used implicitly.\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **Value**: the value of the anonymous object being introduced.\\n* **Assume**: A mathematical assumption being made. In case this is a variable or structure being introduced, use the **let** or **have** type.\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **Statement**: the mathematical assumption.\\n* **Choose**: Set a variable to an element with a property, like **fix** but where existence of an object with the property is proved.\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **Variable**: the variable being defined.\\n    * **Kind**: the type and properties of the variable.\\n    * **Existence**: (optional) A JSON list of objects giving a proof of existence, where it is not obvious that such an object exists.\\n* **Define**: A mathematical definition.\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **Statement**: the mathematical definition.\\n    * **Term**: the term being defined.\\n* **Observe**: A mathematical statement whose proof is a simple calculation or deduction hence can be omitted.\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **Statement**: the mathematical observation.\\n* **Assert**: A mathematical statement whose proof is a straightforward consequence of given results following some method.\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **Claim**: the mathematical claim being asserted, not including justifications or what is used.\\n    * **Deduced_from**: a JSON list of results used to prove the claim, each result either the name of a theorem or a short statement previously proved.\\n    * **Proof-method** (optional): the method of proof for the claim; this should be a single phrase or a fairly simple sentence; if a longer justification is needed break the step into smaller steps.\\n* **Theorem**: The statement of a mathematical theorem, lemma or claim.\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **Hypothesis**: a JSON list of data and assumptions, i.e., **fix**, **let**, **have**, **assume**, or **choose** statements.\\n    * **Conclusion**: the mathematical theorem as a consequence of the assumptions.\\n    * **Status**: one of \"stated\", \"recalled\", \"proved earlier\", \"proved\", \"proved later\".\\n    * Depending on the status, at most one of:\\n      * **Proof**: the proof, if the status is \"proved\".\\n      * **Ref**: reference to earlier proof, if the status is \"proved earlier\" or \"proved later\".\\n      * **Cite**: reference to literature or external sources, if the status is \"recalled\"; for well known results, this is omitted.  \\n* **Question**: A mathematical question that is not a theorem, such as \"Find ...\"\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **Statement**: the problem statement.\\n    * **Solved**: Boolean field whether the solution is given.\\n    * **Solution**: (optional) If the \"solved\" field is true, a \"solution\" field which is a ProofJSON block.\\n* **Problem**: A mathematical problem that is not a theorem, such as \"Find ...\"\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **Statement**: the problem statement.\\n    * **Solved**: Boolean field whether the solution is given.\\n    * **Solution**: (optional) If the \"solved\" field is true, a \"solution\" field which is a ProofJSON block.\\n* **Proof**: A proof of a theorem, lemma or claim.\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **Steps**: a JSON list of steps in the proof.\\n* **Case**: A case in a proof.\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **Condition**: the case statement.\\n    * **Proof**: a ProofJSON block. \\n* **Induction**: An induction in a proof.\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **On**: the variable on which induction is being done.\\n    * **Proof-cases**: a JSON list of cases in the induction, which are all objects of type **case**.\\n* **Cases**: A case split in a proof.\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **On**: the variable, condition or property on which the case split is being done.\\n    * **Proof-cases**: a JSON list of cases in the case split, which are all objects of type **case**.\\n* **Contradiction**: A proof by contradiction.\\n  * Additional fields: \\n    * **Assumption**: the assumption being made to contradict.\\n    * **Proof**: a ProofJSON block proving the negation of the assumption.\\n\\nThe following is a mathematical proof, which may or may not be correct, which is to be written in the JSON format:\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Theorem: Let $A$ be a square matrix. Prove that if $A^2$ is invertible then $A$ is invertible.\\n## Proof: \\nAssume $A^2$ is invertible. Then there exists a matrix $B$ such that $A^2B = BA^2 = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\\n\\nLet $C = AB$. Then, we see that $AC = A(AB) = A^2B = I$.\\n\\nThus, a right inverse for $A$ exists. Since $A$ is a square matrix, the existence of a right inverse also implies the existence of a left inverse (this follows from the rank-nullity theorem or by considering the determinant of $A$), thus proving $A$ is invertible.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nWrite the following proof in the JSON format. Note that the proof may be incorrect. If any step is incorrect or ambiguous, add a field **error** to any of the above types of objects describing the error. If a step needs more proof, add a field **missing** which is a JSON list of **problem** fields which are problems that need to be solved or results that need to be proved to complete the proof. For missing details use a **missing** field, not an **error** field.\\n\\n'"
