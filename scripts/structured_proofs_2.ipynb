The roots of $p(x)$ are the cube roots of unity, namely $1, \\\\omega, \\\\omega^2$, where $\\\\omega = e^{2\\\\pi i/3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity. These roots are distinct, so the minimal polynomial of $A$ must divide $p(x)$ and also have distinct roots.

If any step is incorrect or ambiguous add a field **error** to any of the above types of objects describing the error. If a step needs more proof, add a field **missing** which is a JSON list of **problem** fields which are problems that need to be solved or results that need to be proved to complete the proof.\\n\\n'"
