Given that $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f$ is a convex function. Convex functions defined over $\\mathbb{R}$ are not bounded above. This will be one way to approach the proof.\n",

If $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then the graph of $f(x)$ is concave up everywhere. A function that is concave up everywhere has no maximum (bounded above), since the tangent line at any given point always lies below the graph of the function.\n",

You are asked to show that such a function cannot be bounded above. Here are some methods, techniques, and heuristics that can be used:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use the Definition of a Bounded Function:** Recall that a function is bounded above if there exists a real number M such that $f(x) \\leq M$ for all $x$ in the domain. The goal is to show that no such M can exist for this function.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Second Derivative Test:** The second derivative test is a method in calculus to determine whether a given stationary point for a function is a maximum, minimum, or saddle point. In this case, since $f''(x) > 0$ for all $x$, this implies that the function is always concave up, meaning that it has no local maximum points.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Understanding the Implications of Concavity:** Recall that a function that is concave up everywhere is always increasing. This is a result of the first derivative of the function being strictly increasing, which follows from the fact that the second derivative is greater than zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Direct Comparison or Contradiction:** Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $f$ was bounded above. Then, because $f$ is smooth and hence continuous, by the Extreme Value Theorem, $f$ would attain its maximum at some point, say $c$. But then $f''(c) > 0$ would imply that $f$ is concave up at $c$, which contradicts the fact that $c$ is a maximum.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Limit Arguments:** Since the function is concave up and hence always increasing, we can reason that as $x$ goes to infinity, so should $f(x)$. This can be formally proved using limit arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Use of Calculus Theorems:** The Mean Value Theorem or the Increasing Function Theorem could be used to show that $f$ is strictly increasing. With this information, you can conclude that $f$ is unbounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Examine an Analogous Problem**: You might consider a function such as $f(x) = x^2$, which is a smooth function whose second derivative is always positive and is clearly unbounded above. While this does not constitute a proof for the general case, it can provide a helpful heuristic and an intuitive understanding of why the statement is likely to be true.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Second Derivative Test**: The sign of the second derivative provides information about the concavity of the function. If $f''(x)>0$ for all $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is concave up everywhere on its domain. This implies that the graph of the function is a \"U\" shape curve, meaning it will continue to increase or decrease without bound. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: Since the second derivative is the derivative of the first derivative, we can integrate $f''(x)$ to find an expression for $f'(x)$, and then integrate again to find an expression for $f(x)$. This might help in demonstrating the unbounded nature of $f(x)$.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Monotonicity of Increasing Functions**: If $f''(x)>0$ for all $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$, then it follows that $f'(x)$ is increasing. This means that for any $x_1<x_2$, we have $f'(x_1) \\leq f'(x_2)$. Therefore, $f(x)$ must be increasing at an increasing rate, hence $f(x)$ could not be bounded above.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Comparison to Known Unbounded Functions**: If one can demonstrate that $f(x)$ grows faster than a known unbounded function (like $f(x) = x$ or $f(x) = e^x$), this will prove that $f(x)$ is unbounded. \n",

The given condition $f''(x) > 0$ indicates that the second derivative of the function is positive, which means that the function is strictly convex. \n",

      "In a strictly convex function, any local minimum is also a global minimum. Therefore, it may be useful to split the problem into two cases, based on whether or not the function has a local minimum:\n",

The property of having a positive second derivative means the function is convex, and generally, a convex function will either tend to infinity or negative infinity as x goes to positive or negative infinity, respectively. This problem can be approached by splitting into a few useful cases:\n",

So if $f'(x_0) = 0$, $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x > x_0$. Hence, $f$ is increasing for $x > x_0$ and hence unbounded from above.\n",
