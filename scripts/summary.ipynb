    "Given a homotopy equivalence between manifolds of the same dimension, a fundamental question in topology is whether it is homotopic to a homeomorphism. Basic examples of exotic homotopy equivalences -- ones that are not  homotopic to the homeomorphisms, are maps between surfaces with boundary. For example, the three-holed sphere and the one-holed torus are homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume throughout that all surfaces we consider are oriented. In this note, we show that there is a simple and natural characterisation of when a homotopy equivalence $f\\co \\Sigma_1\\to\\Sigma_2$ between compact surfaces is homotopic to a homeomorphism in terms of the \\emph{Goldman bracket}, which is a Lie Algebra structure associated to a surface. More precisely, if $\\hpi(\\Sigma)$ denotes the set of free homotopy classes of closed curves in $\\Sigma$, then the Goldman bracket (whose definition we recall below) is a bilinear map\n",

    "For closed surfaces, every homotopy equivalence is homotopic to a  homeomorphism. So the corresponding result holds trivially in this case.\n",

    "Homotopy equivalences that are homotopic to homeomorphisms can be characterised as those that preserve the so called \\emph{peripheral structure}. However, our result has the advantage that the characterization is in terms of a structure defined without reference to the boundary.

    "We recall the definition of the Goldman bracket~\\cite{Gol} on a connected surface $\\Sigma$. Let $\\hpi(\\Sigma)$ denote the set of free homotopy classes of curves in $\\Sigma$. For a closed curve $\\alpha$, let $\\langle \\alpha\\rangle\\in\\hpi(\\Sigma)$ denote its homotopy class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given homotopy classes $x$ and $y$ of closed curves, we consider smooth, oriented representatives $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ that intersect transversally in double points.  The bracket of $x$ and $y$ is then defined as the sum\n",

    "For a connected surface $\\Sigma$, if $p\\in\\Sigma$ is a point, $\\hpi(\\Sigma)$ is the set of conjugacy classes in $\\pi_1(\\Sigma,p)$.

A class $x\\in\\hpi$ that is not a non-trivial power is called \\emph{primitive}.\n",

    "Assume further that $\\Sigma$ has negative Euler characteristic, i.e., $\\Sigma$ is not a disc or annulus.

    "\\end{lemma}\n",
    "\\begin{proof}\n",
    "Assume $x$ is peripheral, i.e., $x=\\langle\\alpha\\rangle$ with $\\alpha\\subset \\del\\Sigma$. As any closed curve in $\\Sigma$ is freely homotopic to one in the interior of $\\Sigma$,  every element $y\\in \\hpi(\\Sigma)$ can be represented by a curve $\\beta\\subset int(\\Sigma)$. Hence $\\alpha\\cap\\beta=\\phi$, which implies by Equation~\\ref{bracket} that $[x,y]=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, let $x=\\langle\\alpha\\rangle$ be such that $[x,y]=0$ for all $y\\in\\hpi(\\Sigma)$. If $x$ is not peripheral, it is well known that there is a simple closed curve $\\beta$ so that the geometric intersection number of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is non-zero, i.e., $\\alpha$ is not homotopic to a curve that is disjoint from $\\beta$. This follows from the fact that there is a pair of simple curves in $\\Sigma$ that \\emph{fill} $\\Sigma$ (i.e., all curves with zero geometric intersection with each of them is peripheral), or alternatively by considering the geodesic representative for $x$ with respect to a hyperbolic metric and using the result that geodesics intersect minimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, by Goldman's theorem (Theorem~\\ref{gold}, part~(3)), as the simple closed curve $\\beta$ has non-zero geometric intersection number with $\\alpha$ and $y=\\langle \\beta\\rangle$, we have $[x,y]\\neq 0$, a contradiction.\n",

    "As $x$ is peripheral, by Lemma~\\ref{perinul} $[x,y]=0$ for all $y\\in\\hpi(\\Sigma_1)$. As $f_*$ commutes with the Goldman bracket, it follows that $[f_*(x),f_*(y)]=0$ for all $y\\in\\hpi(\\Sigma_1)$. As $f_*$ is surjective, $[f_*(x),z]=0$ for all $z\\in\\hpi(\\Sigma_2)$.

By Lemma~\\ref{imgbdy}, $\\alpha_i'=f(\\alpha_i)$ represents a primitive peripheral class for $1\\leq i\\leq n$, and hence represents a boundary component $C'_i$. Furthermore, as $\\Sigma_1$ has negative Euler characteristic, for $i\\neq j$, $\\alpha_i\\neq \\alpha_j^{\\pm 1}$, and hence $\\alpha'_i\\neq {\\alpha'}_j^{\\pm 1}$. It follows that the curves $\\alpha_i'$ are homotopic to curves representing distinct boundary components $C_i'$, $1\\leq i\\leq n$.\n",

The class $x$ must be peripheral  by Lemma~\\ref{bdyinv} and primitive as $\\gamma$ is primitive. Hence $x$ is represented by either $\\alpha_i$ or $\\alpha_i^{-1}$ for some $i$, $1\\leq i\\leq n$.

    "Consider a word $X$ in an alphabet consisting of $4$ letters, with the letters viewed either as $\\alpha$, $\\bar{\\alpha}$, $\\beta$ and $\\bar{\\beta}$ (i.e., generators of the free group  $\\F$ and their inverses, where we use the notation $\\bar{g}$ for $g^{-1}$) or $A$, $U$, $G$ and $C$ (i.e., nucleotides in an RNA sequence).  There is a natural notion of a length $\\ell(X)$ associated to such a word, which can be defined in several equivalent ways (see~\\cite{Ga1} and~\\cite{Ga2} for more details). We give three descriptions of $\\ell$, two of which (as we indicate below) generalize to random words in $2k$ letters, for $k\\geq 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{enumerate}\n",
    "  \\item If $X$ is viewed as a word in $\\F$ then $\\ell$ is the maximal conjugacy-invariant length function on $\\F$ which satisfies $\\ell(\\alpha)\\leq 1$ and $\\ell(\\beta)\\leq 1$. Equivalently, $\\ell$ is the word length in the generating set given by all conjugates $g\\alpha g^{-1}$, $g\\bar{\\alpha} g^{-1}$, $g\\bar{\\beta} g^{-1}$ and $g\\beta g^{-1}$ of the generators of $\\F$ and their inverses (where $\\bar{\\alpha}=\\alpha^{-1}$ and $\\bar{\\beta} = \\beta^{-1}$). More generally, an arbitrary word in $2k$ letters gives an element of $\\FF$, and $\\ell$ can be defined as a maximal conjugacy-invariant length function (or word length in conjugates of generators and their inverses) in this case too.\n",
    "  \\item If $X$ is viewed as a nucleotide sequence, then we can consider so called \\emph{secondary structures} of RNA~\\cite{RNA}, i.e., bonds between nucleotides of the RNA, with bonds being Watson-Crick pairs, i.e. hydrogen bonds between Adenine and Uracil and between Guanine and Cytosine, and stereo-chemical forces modelled by not allowing so called \\emph{pseudo-knots} (for details we refer to~\\cite{Ga1}). Then $\\ell(X)$ is the minimum number of non-bonded nucleotides for secondary structures of $X$. This is a biologically reasonable notion of energy.\n",
    "  \\item Again viewing $X=X^{(n)}$ as a word of length $n$ in the alphabet $\\alpha$, $\\bar{\\alpha}$, $\\beta$ and $\\bar{\\beta}$, we consider incomplete non-crossing matchings of the (indices of) letters in $X$ so that letters are matched with their inverses. Here a non-crossing matching is a set $P$ of pairs of indices $(i, j)$, $1\\leq i < j\\leq n$, such that\n",
    "        \\begin{enumerate}\n",
    "          \\item  each $i$ belongs to at most one element of $P$,\n",
    "          \\item  if $i<j<k<\\ell$, then at most one of $(i, k)$ and $(j,\\ell)$ belong to $P$,\n",
    "          \\item  if $(i, j)\\in P$ then $X_i = \\bar{X}_j$.\n",
    "        \\end{enumerate}\n",
    "        The length $\\ell(X)$ is the minimum number of unmatched letters over all non-crossing matchings. More generally we can take a random word in the alphabet with $2k$ letters $\\alpha_1$, $\\bar{\\alpha}_1$, \\dots, $\\alpha_k$, $\\bar{\\alpha}_k$ (where $\\bar{g}$ denotes $g^{-1})$ and consider non-crossing matchings with letters paired with their inverses, and define $\\ell$ as the minimum number of unmatched letters over all non-crossing matchings.\n",
    "\\end{enumerate}\n",
    "\n",
    "Henceforth, fix $k \\geq 2$ and consider a \\emph{random} string $X=X^{(n)}$ of length $n$ in $2k$ letters as above (i.e., a random word). The case $k = 2$ corresponds to RNA secondary structures, but most of our results and proofs are uniform in $k$. Let $L_{k}(n)=\\E\\l[\\ell(X^{(n)})\\r]$ where the expectation is over uniform distribution on strings of length $n$. Let $\\rho_{k}(n)=L_{k}(n)/n$ denote the average proportion of unpaired letters.\n",

    "Our main result is that this fraction converges to a positive constant.\n",
    "\\begin{theorem}\\label{main} With the above notations, $\\rho_{k}(n)\\rightarrow \\lam_{k}$ for some constant $0<\\lambda_k<1$.\n",
    "\\end{theorem}\n",
    "Thus, the average proportion of unpaired bases in an optimal secondary structure for a random RNA string converges to a \\emph{positive} constant as the length of the RNA string approaches infinity. Equivalently, for a word $X$ in the free group $\\F$ (or more generally in the free group $\\FF$ for $k\\geq 2$), the average ratio of the word length of $X$ in the (infinite) generating set consisting of conjugates of generators and their inverses to the word length of $X$ in the standard generators and their inverses converges to a positive constant. We remark that this result is also true, but essentially trivial, for the free group $\\mathbb{Z}$ on $1$ generator (for the group $\\mathbb{Z}$, the two generating sets, hence the corresponding word lengths, coincide).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also show  that  $\\ell(X^n)/n$ has exponential concentration in a window of length $1/\\sqrt{n}$ around its expectation $\\rho_k(n)$, and hence around $\\lambda_{k}$.\n",

    "An immediate corollary is that the standard deviation of $\\ell(X^n)$ is $O(\\sqrt{n})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for proofs, the existence of the limit $\\lambda_k$ and the exponential concentration are proved using sub-additivity and Hoeffding's inequality respectively, which are standard methods in combinatorial optimization problems. Showing that $\\lambda_k$ is strictly positive, and getting  bounds for its value require more involved arguments. It would be  interesting to find the exact value of $\\lambda_k$, particularly $\\lambda_2$. We are only able to get  bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $k=2$, we prove the explicit bounds $0.034< \\lambda_2< 0.231$. The proof of Theorem~\\ref{main} given in Section~\\ref{S:Positive} gives the lower bound of $0.03$, which is then refined to get the slightly better lower bound of $0.034$. Elementary arguments in Section~\\ref*{S:upperbound} give an upper bound of $0.289$ which is improved to $\\frac{3}{13}=0.2307\\ldots$  in Section~\\ref{Sec:greedy}.

Otherwise  $w[t+1]=(w_{1},\\ldots ,w_{j-1})$ where $j$ is the largest index such that $w_j=\\bar{x}$. Two letters get matched each time the length of $w[t]$ reduces.
