## Features

* Integrated interface using elaboration; caching, polling.
* Input-dependent prompting:
    - database of doc-strings from Mathlib
    - selected using: sentence similarity, keywords
* Post-processing:
    - Lean 3 to Lean 4 translation, auto-correction.
        - based on case-transformations, adding/dropping "is" and "has"
    - filtering by elaboration
    - selection by detected equality groups

## Possible improvements

* Interface: code actions
* Prompting:
    - better selection of prompts
    - better/larger database of prompts
    - use proximate prompts
* Post-processing
    - expand auto-correction
    - suggest imports
    - expand equality detection for selection
    - improve selections: round-trips
* Codex improvements:
    - hyper-parameters
    - fine-tuning
