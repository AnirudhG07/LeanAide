Definitions can include
- Metric spaces
- Convergent sequences
- Cauchy sequences
- Complete metric spaces
- Topology and open sets
- Closed sets and some basic proofs
- Connectedness (and other definitions that use familiar natural language words)

Since Lean4 does not yet have an implementation of reals, we can either use the compiled files from the `binport` or implement `‚Ñù` axiomatically as a complete totally ordered field.
